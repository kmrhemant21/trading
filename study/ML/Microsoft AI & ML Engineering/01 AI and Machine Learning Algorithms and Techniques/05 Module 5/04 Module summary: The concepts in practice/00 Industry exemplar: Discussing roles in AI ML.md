## Common roles

AI/ML is an exciting field, but it's also broad, with multiple roles that come together to create successful ML solutions. Here's an overview of some of the most common roles in AI/ML development teams.

### AI/ML engineers

AI/ML engineers focus on building and deploying ML models. Their job is to take data, build models, and make sure those models can scale and be integrated into real-world applications. They handle everything from writing the code for models to fine-tuning performance, ensuring that models can work in production environments. An AI/ML engineer might assist in training a model for deployment, versioning it, and integrating it alongside existing software—for example, a storefront found on a website.

### Data scientists

Data scientists are heavily involved in the early stages of the project, working on research, experimentation, and model selection. They spend a lot of time exploring datasets, selecting the right algorithms, and running experiments to improve model performance. Collaboration between AI/ML engineers and data scientists is critical—one group builds, and the other optimizes and experiments. Data scientists provide equal parts theory and application, but the nuance of application is left to the AI/ML engineers.

### Data engineers

Before data scientists or engineers can start working with data, data engineers make sure the data is ready. They build the data pipelines, clean and transform data, and ensure it's structured in a way that makes it easy to analyze and model. Without solid data engineering, ML models won't perform well. An algorithm is only as robust—and ultimately valuable—as the data that feeds it. It's the job of the data engineer to ensure that data is accurate, clean, and up-to-date.

### Business analysts

Let's not forget about the role of business analysts or stakeholders in the AI/ML process. They help define the problem and provide context on how the models should be used to solve business challenges. They translate business needs into technical tasks and ensure that AI projects are aligned with the company's strategic goals. All the data and analytics provided by the data scientists, engineers, and computer scientists means nothing if a business analyst can't transform it into actionable insight. That's the role of the analyst, and it plays just as important a role.

## Collaboration

In most AI/ML projects, it's rare for one person to handle every part of the workflow. Collaboration is key. AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and data engineers need to work closely to ensure that data flows smoothly, models are built efficiently, and everything integrates seamlessly into production.

AI/ML professionals must work together to make sure that model goals are aligned with the business objectives. For example, if a company is building a recommendation system, data scientists and engineers will need to continually exchange feedback to ensure that the model provides value to the business and improves user experience.

## Specializations

What's great about AI/ML is that you can specialize in a role based on your interests and skills. Here are a few examples.

### Deep learning specialists

These AI/ML engineers focus specifically on building CNNs for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and even autonomous driving. They work on models that require large amounts of data and computational resources.

### Machine learning operations (MLOps) engineers

In recent years, MLOps has become an important specialization. MLOps engineers focus on automating and streamlining the deployment and maintenance of ML models. They work with tools such as Kubernetes and Docker to manage ML infrastructure.

### AI researchers

If you're passionate about cutting-edge innovation, becoming an AI researcher might be the right path for you. Researchers work on advancing AI algorithms and discovering new techniques that push the boundaries of what AI systems can do.

## Industries

AI/ML roles span many industries, from healthcare and finance to retail and entertainment. No matter the industry, AI/ML professionals are tasked with solving real-world problems that impact both businesses and individuals.

### Healthcare

In healthcare, AI/ML engineers work on predictive models that help doctors diagnose diseases earlier or personalize treatments for patients.

### Finance

In finance, data scientists and AI/ML engineers work on fraud detection algorithms, credit risk models, and even algorithmic trading systems. Their work ensures that financial institutions operate more securely and efficiently.

### Retail and e-commerce

In retail, recommendation systems, personalized marketing, and supply chain optimizations are common AI/ML applications. Engineers and data scientists build models that improve customer experience and help businesses optimize their operations.

## Conclusion

In summary, AI/ML is a field with a variety of roles, and each role plays an integral part in the success of any project.
