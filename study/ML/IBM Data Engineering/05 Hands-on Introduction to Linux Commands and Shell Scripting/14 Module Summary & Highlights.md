## Shell Basics
- A shell is an interactive user interface. You use shell commands to navigate and work with files and directories.

## File and URL Operations
- The `curl` and `wget` commands display and download files from URLs
- The `cat` and `tail` commands display file contents

## System Information Commands
- Get user information with the `whoami` and `id` commands
- Get operating system information using the `uname` command
- Check system disk usage using the `df` command
- Monitor processes and resource usage with `ps` and `top`
- Print string or variable value using `echo`
- Print and extract information about the date with the `date` command
- Read the manual for any command using `man`

## File and Directory Navigation
- `ls` lists all files and directories within a specified directory tree
- `cd` navigates between directories
- The `find` command finds files in your directories
- Relative paths are relative to your current working directory, while absolute paths stand independently

## File and Directory Management
- Create files and directories with the `touch` and `mkdir` commands
- Delete them with `rm` and `rmdir`
- Copy and move them with `cp` and `mv`

## File Content Operations
- The `cat`, `more`, `head`, and `tail` commands allow you to sort and view file contents or view only a certain number of lines
- Determine line, word, and character counts with `wc`
- Use `sort` to view the lines of a file alphanumerically
- Use `uniq` to remove repeated lines from your view
- `grep` gets the lines of a file that match your desired criteria
- `cut` extracts slices and fields from lines
- Merge lines from different files using `paste`

## Network Commands
- `hostname` and `ip` allow you to view the network configuration
- Test a network connection using `ping`
- Send and receive data using `curl` and `wget`

## File Compression and Archiving
- Compression preserves storage space, speeds data transfer, and reduces system load
- `zip` compresses files and folders prior to archiving them
- `tar` archives and compresses files and directories into a tarball
- `unzip` unpacks and decompresses a zipped archive
- `tar` can also decompress and unpack a tar.gz archive
