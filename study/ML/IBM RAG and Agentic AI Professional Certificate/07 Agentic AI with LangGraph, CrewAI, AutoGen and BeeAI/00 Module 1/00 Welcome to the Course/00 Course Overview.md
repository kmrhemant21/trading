# Course Overview

Hello, and welcome to the Agentic AI with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and BeeAI course.

This course provides a structured approach to designing AI-powered systems using agentic design principles, multi-agent frameworks, and proven workflow patterns. 

You will begin by exploring the fundamentals of agentic frameworks and multi-agent systems, with a focus on implementing workflow patterns using LangGraph. Then, you'll explore CrewAI, a framework for orchestrating agents, tasks, and tools to build structured and modular AI workflows. Finally, you will explore alternative agentic frameworks such as IBM's BeeAI and AG2 (formerly AutoGen) to create intelligent agents and conversation-driven interactions. 

Through hands-on labs and real-world use cases, you will gain the skills needed to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient AI applications by selecting and combining the right frameworks and design patterns.

This course is part of the **IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate**, designed to provide you with the practical skills and knowledge to excel in developing advanced AI applications that leverage RAG, multimodal AI, and agentic AI systems.
