In trading jargon, **‚Äúgoing long‚Äù** and **‚Äúgoing short‚Äù** refer to the two basic ways you can position yourself on whether a security‚Äôs price will rise or fall:

---

### üü¢ Going Long

* **What it means:** You **buy** a security (stock, ETF, etc.) expecting its price to **rise**.
* **Profit if:** The price goes **up**.
* **Example:**

  * You buy 100 shares of XYZ at ‚Çπ200 each (outlay = ‚Çπ20,000).
  * If XYZ rises to ‚Çπ230 and you sell, you receive ‚Çπ23,000.
  * Your **profit** = ‚Çπ23,000 ‚àí ‚Çπ20,000 = ‚Çπ3,000.

This is the most common retail trading approach: ‚Äúbuy low, sell high.‚Äù

### üî¥ Going Short

* **What it means:** You **sell** a security you don‚Äôt own (typically borrowing it via your broker) expecting its price to **fall**. You later **buy to cover** that same quantity at a (hopefully) lower price.
* **Profit if:** The price goes **down**.
* **Example:**

  * You borrow and sell 100 shares of ABC at ‚Çπ500 each, so you receive ‚Çπ50,000.
  * If ABC falls to ‚Çπ450, you buy 100 shares back (cover) for ‚Çπ45,000.
  * You return those shares to your broker and keep the difference: **profit** = ‚Çπ50,000 ‚àí ‚Çπ45,000 = ‚Çπ5,000.
  * If instead ABC rose to ‚Çπ550, covering would cost ‚Çπ55,000 and you‚Äôd incur a loss of ‚Çπ5,000.

### Key Points

* **Margin requirement:** Shorting usually requires a margin account and carries interest/collateral requirements.
* **Risk profiles:**

  * **Long:** Maximum loss is what you paid (price can‚Äôt go below zero).
  * **Short:** Theoretically unlimited loss, because a stock‚Äôs price can rise without bound.
* **Closing positions:**

  * **Long:** ‚ÄúSell to close.‚Äù
  * **Short:** ‚ÄúBuy to cover‚Äù (then return the borrowed shares).

**In summary:**

* **Long = buy first, sell later ‚Üí profits if price ‚Üë**.
* **Short = sell first (borrowed), buy later ‚Üí profits if price ‚Üì**.
