# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 

- Multi-agent systems are fundamentally about organized specializationâ€”assigning the right agent to the right task. These systems consist of multiple autonomous agents interacting within an environment.  

- **Agent specialization concepts include:**  
    - Capability boundaries where each agent should have a well-defined and focused scope  
    - Expertise depth and breadth to balance highly specialized agents with broad generalist agents  
    - Interface standardization to ensure agents communicate through structured inputs and outputs  
    - Finally, handoff patterns to ensure agents should gracefully pass tasks to other agents when the task falls outside their specific expertise  

- Agents primarily interact in what are known as graph-structured systems, for example:  
    - In Pipeline Pattern, agents perform sequential handoffs, passing their output directly as input to the next agent in line.  
    - In Hub-and-Spoke Pattern, a central coordinator dispatches tasks to various specialist agents  

- Orchestration frameworks such as LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and IBM BeeAI Framework are used to manage complex interactions among AI agents.  

- Model Context Protocol or MCP standardizes how AI models access and share context with external tools and data sources. Agent Communication Protocol or ACP provides a standardized method for AI agents to communicate and collaborate.  

- Challenges in building multi-agent systems include coordination complexity, communication overhead, and security concerns.  

- Agentic RAG enhances RAG by letting an LLM act as a decision-making agent, not just a responder. The agent selects the most relevant data source based on the query context. It boosts accuracy, adaptability, and real-world applicability across industries.
