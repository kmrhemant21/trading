    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will compare the performance of the Keras-based and the PyTorch based convolutional neural network (CNN) models using various evaluation metrics.  Common metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model is correct overall. A higher value means more total predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Measures how many predicted positives are actually correct. A higher value means fewer false positives (incorrectly predicted positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**: Measures how many real positives the model finds. A higher value means fewer false negatives (missed positive cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: Tells us about the balance between precision and recall. A higher value means a better trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish classes. A higher value reflects a model that can better distinguish between classes at all probability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these metrics, the model should aim for values as close to 1.0 (or 100%) as possible. Lower values indicate poorer model performance. There are exceptions for some metrics in other settings (like various loss functions, where lower is better), but for these standard classification metrics, higher is always better.\n"
