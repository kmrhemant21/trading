# Module 1 Summary: Data Engineering and Generative AI

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

## Data Engineering AI Integration

Data engineers can integrate AI tools into their workflows and streamline their tasks with:

- Synthetic data generation
- Data augmentation
- Data anonymization
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data exploration and visualization

## AI Model Types

- **Generative models** focus on the distribution of data to generate new instances, while **discriminative models** separate data points into classes.
- **GANs** comprise two competing neural networks.
- **VAEs** are models that learn to encode data into a compressed representation and then decode it.
- **Transformers'** self-attention mechanisms allow for understanding and generating complex data patterns, revolutionizing creative and generative tasks across various domains.

## Core Data Engineering Responsibilities

The core responsibilities of data engineers include:
- Maintenance of data infrastructure
- Development of ETL processes
- Compliance with data quality and governance

## AI Tools in Practice

- **DataRobot** automates data cleaning and preparation
- **GPT-3** generates predictive text and simulates scenarios

## Transformative AI Solutions

Transformative generative AI solutions include:
- Dynamic data storage and processing
- Advanced data integration
- Efficient data management

## Schema Design with AI

Generative AI approaches schema design by learning from vast data patterns and existing database structures.
