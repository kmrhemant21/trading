# Walkthrough: Creating an AI/ML development plan for customer churn prediction (Optional)

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we will cover a step-by-step solution for the AI/ML development plan for the fictitious project that was presented. The project focuses on building an ML model to predict customer churn for a retail company. The goal is to create a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to stop using the service, enabling the business to take proactive measures for retention.

By the end of this walkthrough, you will be able to:

- Understand the steps involved in developing an ML model for customer churn prediction.
- Identify the key components of problem formulation, data preparation, model selection, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance.
- Apply best practices in AI/ML engineering to create a robust predictive model that can enhance customer retention strategies.

## Step-by-step solution for an AI/ML development plan

### Step 1: Problem statement

The retail company wants to predict which of their customers are likely to churn (stop using the service). By identifying these customers early, the company can take steps to retain them through targeted offers, better customer service, or other interventions.

- **Objective**: predict customer churn based on historical customer data.
- **Business impact**: reducing churn rates directly impacts revenue growth by increasing customer retention and reducing acquisition costs.
- **Model output**: the model will output a probability score for each customer, indicating the likelihood that they will churn. Customers with a score above a certain threshold will be flagged as "at risk."

### Step 2: Data requirements

To build a predictive model, we need a well-prepared dataset that includes relevant features for predicting customer churn. Here's how we would handle the data:

#### Data sources
- Customer demographics: age, gender, location, etc.
- Purchase history: total amount spent, frequency of purchases, time since last purchase.
- Customer service interactions: number of interactions, type of interactions (complaints, inquiries).
- Subscription status: whether the customer has an active subscription and for how long.

#### Data preprocessing
- Handling missing data: use mean imputation or median imputation for numerical variables and mode imputation for categorical variables.
- Encoding categorical variables: use one-hot encoding for variables such as customer region or subscription type.
- Normalizing numerical data: normalize continuous variables, such as total amount spent and interaction frequency, to ensure the model isn't biased by the scale of data.

#### Feature engineering
- Create new features, such as customer tenure (number of months since the customer's first purchase) and purchase recency (time since the last purchase).
- Generate interaction frequency from customer service logs (how often customers contact support).

### Step 3: ML approach

For this project, we will experiment with several models commonly used for classification tasks, as churn prediction is a binary classification problem.

#### Model selection
- Logistic regression: a simple and interpretable model that provides probability scores for classification.
- Decision trees: useful for handling both numerical and categorical data. The decision tree model will help us understand feature importance and how decisions are made.
- Random forest: an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

#### Data splitting
We will split the data into 80 percent for training and 20 percent for testing. Additionally, we will use k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold cross-validation) to ensure that the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting.

### Step 4: Model evaluation

Once we have trained the models, we will evaluate their performance using classification metrics to ensure they are accurate and reliable.

#### Evaluation metrics
- Accuracy: measures the overall correctness of predictions but may not be sufficient for imbalanced datasets (where churn is rare).
- Precision: focuses on the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives (helps in avoiding false positives).
- Recall: emphasizes identifying as many true positives as possible (reducing false negatives).
- F1-score: balances precision and recall, making it ideal for imbalanced classes.
- ROC-AUC: measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes. A high AUC score indicates a good model.

#### Performance comparison
We will compare the models based on these metrics and select the best-performing one. In this case, random forests are likely to outperform simpler models such as logistic regression due to their ability to handle complex patterns in the data.

### Step 5: Model deployment

After selecting the best model, the next step is to deploy it so that the business can use it to make real-time predictions.

#### Deployment platform
We will use a cloud platform such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud AI for deployment. These platforms allow us to deploy models at scale and provide APIs for integration with other systems.

#### Integration
- We will create an API endpoint that allows customer data to be sent to the model in real-time for prediction.
- The output from the model (probability of churn) will be integrated into the company's CRM system. This will allow the customer service or marketing teams to take immediate action (e.g., contacting high-risk customers with special offers).
- Optionally, we could develop a dashboard where stakeholders can see churn predictions and monitor customer behavior.

### Step 6: Monitoring and maintenance

Once deployed, we need to ensure that the model continues to perform well over time, especially as customer behavior or company dynamics change.

#### Monitoring tools
- Set up monitoring using cloud services such as Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch to track the model's performance in production.
- Monitor key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall over time to ensure the model isn't degrading (known as model drift).

#### Retraining the model
- We will plan for periodic retraining of the model every three to six months using the latest data. This will ensure that the model adapts to any changes in customer behavior or new trends.
- We will also establish a process to trigger retraining if the model's performance drops below a certain threshold, detected through ongoing monitoring.

## Conclusion

By following this AI/ML development plan, you can create an end-to-end solution for customer churn prediction that aligns with business goals. The process covers everything from defining the problem and preparing data to model selection, evaluation, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. This approach ensures that the ML model remains a valuable asset to the business, helping it improve customer retention and, ultimately, revenue.
