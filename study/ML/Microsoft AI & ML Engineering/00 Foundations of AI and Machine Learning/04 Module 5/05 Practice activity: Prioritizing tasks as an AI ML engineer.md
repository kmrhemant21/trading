# Practice activity: Prioritizing tasks as an AI/ML engineer

## Introduction
As an AI/ML engineer, you'll often face multiple tasks that need your attention, each with its own level of urgency and impact on the overall project. Knowing how to prioritize these tasks effectively is crucial to managing your workload and ensuring the success of your projects. In this activity, you will practice prioritizing between five potential activities you might encounter on the job.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to: 

- Evaluate and prioritize different tasks in an AI/ML project environment based on their urgency, impact, and dependencies. 
- Manage your workload.

## Activity overview
**Scenario**: You are working on a major AI/ML project for a retail company, focusing on developing a recommendation system that will personalize product suggestions for customers. As the project progresses, you encounter several tasks that require your attention. Your goal is to prioritize these tasks based on their urgency, impact on the project, and your team’s overall objectives.

### The five tasks

#### Task 1: Model accuracy improvement
**Description**: Your initial model is performing adequately but not as well as expected. The accuracy of the recommendations needs improvement to meet the project's goals. You need to dedicate time to fine-tune hyperparameters and explore alternative algorithms.

**Considerations**: Improving accuracy is critical to the success of the recommendation system, as it directly impacts user satisfaction and the effectiveness of the product recommendations.

#### Task 2: Data pipeline optimization
**Description**: The data pipeline that feeds data into your model is functioning but is slower than optimal. This is causing delays in the data processing time, which could lead to lag in real-time recommendations.

**Considerations**: Optimizing the data pipeline will enhance the efficiency of the system, ensuring that data is processed quickly and accurately, which is crucial for real-time applications.

#### Task 3: Interface integration with front-end
**Description**: The front-end team is waiting for your model’s output to be fully integrated with the user interface. They need your input to ensure that the recommendations are displayed correctly and in a user-friendly manner.

**Considerations**: Interface integration is essential for delivering the model’s outputs to the end-users. However, it’s also dependent on the accuracy and speed of the underlying model and data pipeline.

#### Task 4: Model deployment in production
**Description**: Your model is ready for deployment, but you need to set up the necessary infrastructure and ensure that the model can handle production-level traffic. This includes configuring cloud resources and setting up monitoring tools.

**Considerations**: Deploying the model to production is a critical step in making the system operational. Without deployment, the model cannot start providing value to the users.

#### Task 5: Addressing a bug in the training script
**Description**: A bug has been discovered in the script used to train your model. The bug is causing the training process to be slower than expected, and it might also affect the accuracy of the model.

**Considerations**: Addressing the bug is important to ensure the model is trained correctly and efficiently. However, the urgency depends on whether the bug is causing significant errors or delays in the overall project timeline.

## Activity instructions

### Step-by-step guide:

#### Step 1: Evaluate the tasks
Start by carefully reading through the descriptions of the five tasks listed above. Consider the following questions for each task:

- **Impact**: How critical is this task to the overall success of the project? Does it directly affect the model’s performance, user experience, or the project’s timeline?
- **Urgency**: How time-sensitive is this task? Does it need to be addressed immediately, or can it be scheduled for later?
- **Dependencies**: Are there any dependencies between tasks? For example, can the model be deployed before the data pipeline is optimized, or does the interface integration depend on the model’s accuracy?

#### Step 2: Prioritize the tasks
Based on your evaluation, prioritize the five tasks from most to least important. Rank them one through five, with one being the highest priority and five being the lowest. Consider both the immediate needs of the project and the long-term impact of each task.

#### Step 3: Justify your prioritization
Write a brief justification (one or two sentences) for the order in which you prioritized the tasks. Explain why you believe each task should be addressed in the order you chose.

#### Step 4: Reflect on the decision-making process
After completing your prioritization, take a moment to reflect on the decision-making process. Were there any tasks that were particularly difficult to prioritize? How did you balance the immediate needs of the project with long-term considerations?

### Example of task prioritization
The order below is an example of a task prioritization strategy focused on resolving foundational issues and dependencies, ensuring that each subsequent task builds on a stable and optimized base for the recommendation system.

1. **Task 5: Addressing a bug in the training script**  
    **Justification**: Fixing the bug is crucial because it directly affects the accuracy and efficiency of the model. If the model is trained incorrectly, it will impact all subsequent tasks, making this the highest priority.

2. **Task 1: Model accuracy improvement**  
    **Justification**: Once the bug is fixed, improving the model’s accuracy should be the next priority to ensure that the recommendations are effective and meet the project’s goals.

3. **Task 2: Data pipeline optimization**  
    **Justification**: Optimizing the data pipeline is important for ensuring that the system can handle real-time data processing, which is critical for delivering accurate and timely recommendations.

4. **Task 4: Model deployment in production**  
    **Justification**: Deployment is a high priority but should come after ensuring that the model and data pipeline are performing optimally. This will prevent issues once the model is live in production.

5. **Task 3: Interface integration with front-end**  
    **Justification**: While interface integration is essential for the end-user experience, it should be done after the model is accurate, the data pipeline is optimized, and the model is deployed. This will ensure that the integration process goes smoothly.

**Reflection**: The prioritization process required balancing immediate technical needs (such as fixing the bug) with long-term project goals (such as optimizing the data pipeline). Addressing dependencies was critical in deciding the order of tasks, as some tasks needed to be completed before others could proceed.

## Conclusion
This activity is designed to help you develop the critical skill of prioritizing tasks in a dynamic and complex environment. By practicing how to evaluate and prioritize different tasks, you’ll be better prepared to manage your workload effectively and contribute to the success of your AI/ML projects.
