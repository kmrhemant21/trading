# Discussion: Comparative analysis of learning paradigms

## Discussion prompt

For this discussion post, you will choose one learning paradigm—supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or RL—and apply it to a dummy use case of your choice.

- **Use case selection**: choose a simple hypothetical scenario where your chosen learning paradigm can be applied (e.g., supervised learning for predicting product prices, unsupervised learning for clustering customer data, or RL for training an AI to navigate a maze).

- **Comparative analysis**: explain why your chosen learning paradigm is suitable for this use case. Compare it to at least one other learning paradigm and discuss why that alternative would be less effective or inappropriate for your selected use case.

- **Evaluation**: describe how you would evaluate the success of the model using key metrics (e.g., accuracy for supervised learning, silhouette score for unsupervised learning, cumulative rewards for RL).

Your post should be between 200–300 words. Be specific about the problem you are solving and the learning method you've chosen. Use clear reasoning to support your choice and provide examples where applicable. Read and respond to at least two other posts from your peers. Offer constructive feedback, ask questions, or propose alternative methods where appropriate.

## Example discussion post 

For my use case, I'm choosing supervised learning to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage and the number of bedrooms. Supervised learning is ideal here because we have labeled data (house features and their corresponding prices). By training a model like linear regression, we can predict prices for new homes.

In contrast, unsupervised learning, such as k-means clustering, would not be suitable because there are no natural clusters or patterns to be identified; we need exact price predictions. The model's success could be evaluated using metrics such as MSE, which measures how close the predictions are to the actual prices.
