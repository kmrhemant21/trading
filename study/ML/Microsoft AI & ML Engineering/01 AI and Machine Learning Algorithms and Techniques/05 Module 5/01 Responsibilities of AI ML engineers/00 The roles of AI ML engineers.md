# The roles of AI/ML engineers

## Introduction

Imagine you've built an AI model that perfectly predicts customer churn in the lab. But when you deploy it, it fails spectacularly, costing your company millions. What went wrong? If you've worked with AI/ML models before, you know that building them is only part of the challenge. 

In this reading, you'll learn how AI/ML engineers take projects to the next level by mastering the entire life cycle—from model development to deployment and ongoing maintenance. You'll also cover practical insights to refine your approach, improve scalability, and ensure your models perform reliably in real-world environments.

By the end of this reading, you will be able to:

- Describe the key responsibilities of AI/ML engineers across the model life cycle. 
- Explain how AI/ML engineers ensure model scalability and reliability in production.
- Identify the collaborative aspects of an AI/ML engineer's role.

AI/ML engineers are primarily responsible for designing, developing, and deploying ML models and AI systems. Their core responsibilities typically fall into a few key areas.

## Core responsibilities of an AI/ML engineer 

### Data collection and preprocessing

AI/ML engineers gather large datasets from various sources and then clean, preprocess, and structure this data to make it suitable for ML models. This includes handling missing data, removing outliers, and normalizing or scaling features to ensure the models can learn effectively. For example, engineers might collect customer transaction data in a retail scenario and preprocess it by removing invalid or incomplete transactions, normalizing spending amounts, and encoding categorical variables such as payment methods to make the data usable for modeling.

### Model development 

Once the data is ready, AI/ML engineers build and train models to solve specific problems, such as predicting trends, classifying images, or automating decision-making processes. They often experiment with different algorithms like neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines  to find the best fit for the problem at hand. For example, in healthcare, an engineer may train a neural network to classify medical images, such as identifying tumors in X-rays, allowing doctors to make faster and more accurate diagnoses.

### Model evaluation and optimization 

AI/ML engineers must evaluate a model's performance after its development. They use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, or mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared for regression tasks. They may then optimize the model's hyperparameters and fine-tune its architecture to maximize performance. For example, in finance, they build algorithms for fraud detection and predictive analytics, helping banks identify suspicious transactions or forecast market trends more accurately.

### Deployment

Beyond building models, AI/ML engineers are responsible for deploying these systems into production environments. This often involves integrating ML models into existing software applications or cloud infrastructure.

- **Deployment**: AI/ML engineers ensure the efficient deployment of models to handle real-time data and user interactions. They might use cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud AI to deploy models at scale.

- **Scalability**: AI/ML engineers must design their systems to scale as the business grows. This means ensuring that the models can handle increased data volumes, user demand, and more complex tasks without sacrificing performance.

Scaling AI/ML systems requires a strong understanding of software engineering principles and infrastructure management, making this a vital aspect of an AI/ML engineer's role.

### Ongoing monitoring and maintenance 

AI/ML models don't end with deployment—they require ongoing maintenance. AI/ML engineers continuously monitor their systems to ensure performance remains high over time.

- **Model drift**: Models can become less accurate as data evolves—a phenomenon known as model drift. AI/ML engineers are responsible for detecting drift and retraining models when necessary to maintain their effectiveness.

- **Performance monitoring**: Engineers set up monitoring tools and dashboards to track key performance metrics and alert teams if something goes wrong. This ensures that models continue to deliver reliable predictions and insights.

Engineers ensure that by maintaining and updating AI/ML models, their systems remain useful and relevant in the long term.

### Collaboration

AI/ML engineers don't work in isolation. They collaborate closely with other teams, such as data scientists, software developers, and business stakeholders. This ensures that the AI/ML solutions they develop align with business goals and are technically sound.

- **With data scientists**: AI/ML engineers work together to experiment with algorithms, test models, and derive insights from data.

- **With software developers**: Engineers integrate ML models into production software, ensuring smooth functionality and user experience.

- **With business teams**: They communicate the impact of their models, demonstrating how AI/ML solutions can drive better decision-making and achieve business objectives.

Collaboration is key to AI/ML engineering success, as it ensures that technical solutions meet real-world needs.
