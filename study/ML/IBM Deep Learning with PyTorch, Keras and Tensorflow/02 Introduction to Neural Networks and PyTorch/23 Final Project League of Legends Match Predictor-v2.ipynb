    "League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Perform the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.  \n",

    "3 .Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:\n",
    "Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide the data. Set `test_size`=0.2 to allocate 20% for testing and 80% for training, and use `random_state`=42 to ensure reproducibility of the split.</br>\n",
    "4. Standardize the features:\n",
    "Use `StandardScaler()` from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the features.</br>\n",
    "5. Convert to PyTorch tensors:\n",

It helps prevent the model from overfitting by penalizing large weight values, thereby encouraging the model to find simpler solutions.To use L2 regularization, you need to modify the optimizer by setting the weight_decay parameter.

    "Congratulations on completing the project! In this final project, you built a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches based on various in-game statistics. This comprehensive project involved several key steps, including data loading and preprocessing, model implementation, training, optimization, evaluation, visualization, model saving and loading, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis. This project provided hands-on experience with the complete workflow of developing a machine learning model for binary classification tasks using PyTorch.\n",
