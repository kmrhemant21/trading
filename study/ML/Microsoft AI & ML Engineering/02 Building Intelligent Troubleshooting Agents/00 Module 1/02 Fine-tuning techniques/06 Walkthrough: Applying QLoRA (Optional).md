# Walkthrough: Applying QLoRA (Optional)

## Introduction

In this reading, we'll go step-by-step through the proper solution for the activity in which you applied Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) to fine-tune a pretrained model. By following these steps, you will understand how to fine-tune a large model efficiently using both quantization and low-rank adaptations to minimize memory usage and computational requirements.

By the end of this walkthrough, you will be able to:

- List the principles behind QLoRA and its advantages for fine-tuning large models.
- Apply QLoRA to pretrained models to reduce memory and computational overhead.
- Fine-tune models using QLoRA while maintaining strong performance on task-specific datasets.
- Evaluate the performance of a QLoRA-fine-tuned model using standard evaluation metrics.
- Optimize the rank and quantization levels in QLoRA to balance efficiency and accuracy for specific tasks.

## Step-by-step process to fine-tuning with QLORA

This reading will guide you through the following steps:

1. Step 1: Prepare the dataset
2. Step 2: Apply QLoRA to the model
3. Step 3: Fine-tune the QLoRA-enhanced model
4. Step 4: Evaluate the fine-tuned model
5. Step 5: Optimize QLoRA for better performance

### Step 1: Prepare the dataset

Before applying QLoRA, the first step is to prepare the dataset, ensuring it is properly structured and split for training, validation, and testing. Preprocessing includes cleaning, tokenizing, and padding the text to make it suitable for fine-tuning.

#### Instructions

1. Load the dataset and inspect the data to understand its structure and labels.
2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.
3. Apply preprocessing steps, such as text cleaning, tokenization, and padding.

#### Code example

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets
train_data, temp_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
val_data, test_data = train_test_split(temp_data, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {len(train_data)}")
print(f"Validation set size: {len(val_data)}")
print(f"Test set size: {len(test_data)}")
```

#### Explanation

We split the dataset into three subsets: training (70 percent), validation (15 percent), and test (15 percent) to ensure we can monitor the model's performance during and after training. The training data will be used to fine-tune the model, while the validation data helps avoid overfitting, and the test data evaluates the final model.

### Step 2: Apply QLoRA to the model

In this step, we apply QLoRA to the pretrained model. First, the model is quantized to reduce memory usage, and then LoRA is applied to specific layers (e.g., attention layers or feed-forward networks), which are then fine-tuned.

#### Instructions

1. Load a pretrained model (e.g., BERT or GPT).
2. Apply quantization to reduce the memory footprint.
3. Use LoRA to add low-rank adaptation to specific layers (e.g., attention heads).
4. Freeze the remaining parameters to ensure only the low-rank matrices are fine-tuned.

#### Clarification

In the code, the param.requires_grad = False syntax freezes all the parameters in the base model by setting requires_grad to False. This ensures that these parameters are not updated during backpropagation. However, the LoRA-applied layers (e.g., attention heads) are excluded from this freezing, as they were specifically modified with LoRA. The parameters within those layers retain requires_grad = True, allowing them to be fine-tuned. This selective freezing helps reduce memory usage and computational requirements by ensuring that only the low-rank matrices introduced by LoRA are updated.

#### Code example

```python
from transformers import GPT2ForSequenceClassification
from qlora import QuantizeModel, LoRALayer

# Load pretrained GPT-2 model
model = GPT2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Quantize the model to reduce memory usage
quantized_model = QuantizeModel(model, bits=8)

# Apply LoRA to specific layers (e.g., attention layers)
for name, module in quantized_model.named_modules():
    if 'attention' in name:
        module.apply(LoRALayer)

# Freeze remaining layers
for param in quantized_model.base_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

#### Explanation

We apply quantization to reduce the model's precision, making it more memory-efficient. LoRA is then applied to the attention layers, allowing only the low-rank matrices to be fine-tuned. The rest of the model's parameters remain frozen.

### Step 3: Fine-tune the QLoRA-enhanced model

With QLoRA applied, we proceeded to fine-tune the model on the task-specific dataset. This step updates only the quantized low-rank matrices introduced by LoRA while the rest of the model remains unchanged, making the fine-tuning process more efficient.

#### Instructions

1. Set up the training arguments, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
2. Fine-tune the model on the training dataset, using validation data to monitor performance.

#### Code example

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

# Fine-tune the QLoRA-enhanced model
trainer = Trainer(
    model=quantized_model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_data,
    eval_dataset=val_data,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

#### Explanation

We use the Trainer from Hugging Face to handle the fine-tuning process. The low-rank matrices created by LoRA are fine-tuned using the training data, while the validation data is used to monitor the model's progress and avoid overfitting.

### Step 4: Evaluate the fine-tuned model

After the fine-tuning process, evaluating the model on the test set is essential to measure its performance on unseen data. Standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will help you understand how well the model generalizes.

#### Instructions

1. Evaluate the model on the test set using standard metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
2. Compare the results to a traditionally fine-tuned model to observe the resource savings and performance trade-offs of QLoRA.

#### Code example

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test set
results = trainer.evaluate(eval_dataset=test_data)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results['eval_accuracy']}")
```

#### Explanation

The evaluation quantitatively measures how well the QLoRA-enhanced model performs on new, unseen examples. You should expect to achieve performance close to traditional fine-tuning while using far fewer computational resources.

### Step 5: Optimize QLoRA for better performance

While QLoRA is designed to be efficient, you can further optimize the fine-tuning process by experimenting with different ranks for the low-rank matrices or adjusting the quantization levels.

#### Optional instructions

- Try adjusting the rank of the low-rank matrices (increasing or decreasing the rank based on your needs).
- Alternatively, you can experiment with adjusting the quantization levels to see how this impacts model performance and memory usage.

#### Code example

```python
from qlora import adjust_qlora_rank

# Adjust the rank of the low-rank matrices
adjust_qlora_rank(quantized_model, rank=4)  # You can experiment with different rank values
```

#### Explanation

Instead of only adjusting the rank of the low-rank matrices, you can experiment with different quantization levels (e.g., 4 bits, 8 bits) to explore how reducing the precision of model weights affects performance and memory efficiency. This lets you see the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy in fine-tuning large models.

## Conclusion

In this walkthrough, we explored the step-by-step solution for fine-tuning a pretrained model using QLoRA. By applying quantization and low-rank adaptation, you can fine-tune large models more efficiently without sacrificing significant performance. This technique is ideal for situations where computational resources are limited or where rapid iterations are needed.
