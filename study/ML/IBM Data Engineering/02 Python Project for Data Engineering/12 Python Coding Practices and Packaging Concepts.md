# Module Summary: Python Coding Practices and Packaging Concepts

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

## PEP8 Guidelines for Code Readability

The PEP8 guidelines for code readability include the following:

- Four spaces for indentation
- Blank lines to separate functions and classes
- Spaces around operators and after commas

## PEP8 Coding Conventions

The PEP8 coding conventions for consistency and manageability include:

- Add larger blocks of code inside functions
- Name functions and files using lowercase with underscores
- Name classes using CamelCase
- Name constants in capital letters with underscores separating words

## Static Code Analysis

To ensure that your code adheres to the predefined style and standard without executing the code, you can use the **Static code analysis** method.

## Unit Testing

**Unit testing** is a method to validate if code units are operating as designed. You must test every unit before integration with the final codebase.

## Creating a Package

To create a package:

1. Create a folder with the package name
2. Create an empty `__init__.py` file
3. Create the required modules
4. In the `__init__.py` file, add code to reference the modules needed in the package

You can verify the package via the bash terminal in a Python shell.
