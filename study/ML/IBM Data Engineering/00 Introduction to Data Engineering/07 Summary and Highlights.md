# Summary and Highlights

In this lesson, you have learned:

## Data Sourcing Methods
Depending on where the data must be sourced from, there are a number of methods and tools available for gathering data. These include:
- Query languages for extracting data from databases
- APIs
- Web Scraping
- Data Streams
- RSS Feeds
- Data Exchanges

## Data Wrangling Process
Once the data you need has been gathered and imported, your next step is to make it analytics-ready. This is where the process of **Data Wrangling**, or **Data Munging**, comes in.

### Data Transformation
Data Wrangling involves a whole range of transformations and cleansing activities performed on the data. Transformation of raw data includes the tasks you undertake to:

- **Structurally manipulate and combine data** using Joins and Unions
- **Normalize data** - clean the database of unused and redundant data
- **Denormalize data** - combine data from multiple tables into a single table so that it can be queried faster

### Data Cleansing Activities
Cleansing activities include:

- **Profiling data** to uncover anomalies and quality issues
- **Visualizing data** using statistical methods in order to spot outliers
- **Fixing issues** such as:
    - Missing values
    - Duplicate data
    - Irrelevant data
    - Inconsistent formats
    - Syntax errors
    - Outliers

## Data Wrangling Tools
A variety of software and tools are available for the data wrangling process. Some of the popularly used ones include:

- Excel Power Query
- Spreadsheets
- OpenRefine
- Google DataPrep
- Watson Studio Refinery
- Trifacta Wrangler
- Python
- R

Each tool has their own set of features, strengths, limitations, and applications.
