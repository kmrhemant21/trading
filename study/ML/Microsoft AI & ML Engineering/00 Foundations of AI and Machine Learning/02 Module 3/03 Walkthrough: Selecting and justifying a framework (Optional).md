## 1. Analyzing the problem

**Problem recap:** The goal is to build a recommendation system that can suggest products to customers based on their previous purchases, browsing behavior, and demographic information. The system needs to handle large datasets efficiently and provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

**Key considerations**

- **Data type and volume:** The dataset includes customer transaction histories, product information, and user ratings, which are likely to be large and diverse.
- **Model complexity:** A recommendation system can range from simple collaborative filtering techniques to complex deep learning models such as neural collaborative filtering (NCF) or matrix factorization.
- **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users and products over time.
- **Ease of integration:** The framework should support easy integration with existing systems and tools commonly used in the industry.

## 2. Selecting a framework

Given the nature of the problem and the key considerations, two primary frameworks emerge as strong candidates:

### Option 1: TensorFlow strengths

TensorFlow is highly scalable and supports advanced deep learning models, making it ideal for complex recommendation systems. It offers robust tools for handling large datasets and provides pre-built models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. TensorFlow also integrates well with other tools and platforms, including cloud services such as Google Cloud AI.

### Option 2: PyTorch strengths

PyTorch is known for its ease of use and flexibility, particularly in research and prototyping. It supports dynamic computation graphs, which can be helpful for experimenting with different model architectures. PyTorch also has strong support for deep learning models and provides extensive community resources and libraries.
