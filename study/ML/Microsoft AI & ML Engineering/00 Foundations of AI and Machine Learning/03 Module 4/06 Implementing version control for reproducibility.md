### 1. Version control for code using Git  

## Overview  
Git is the industry standard for version control of code. It allows you to track changes, manage different versions of your project, and collaborate with others seamlessly.  

## Step-by-step guide  

**Step 1: Initialize a Git repository**  

- **Create a new repository**  
    Navigate to your project directory and initialize a Git repository:  
    ```bash
    git init
    ```  
    This command creates a hidden `.git` directory that will track all changes to your project.  

- **Add your project files**  
    Add your project files to the repository:  
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```  
    This stages all your files for the first commit.  

- **Make your first commit**  
    Commit the staged files with a descriptive message:  
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of project files"
    ```  
    This saves a snapshot of your current project state in the repository.  

**Step 2: Use branches for experiments**  

- **Create a new branch**  
    When working on a new feature or experiment, create a new branch to isolate your changes:  
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-new-experiment
    ```  

- **Commit changes to the branch**  
    As you make changes, commit them to your branch:  
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added data preprocessing steps for new experiment"
    ```  

- **Merge changes when ready**  
    Once your experiment is successful, merge the branch back into the main branch:  
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-new-experiment
    ```  

**Step 3: Collaborate with remote repositories**  

- **Push your branch to a remote repository**  
    To collaborate with others or back up your work, push your branch to a remote repository like GitHub or GitLab:  
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-new-experiment
    ```  

- **Pull requests for code reviews**  
    When your work is ready, create a pull request on platforms like GitHub to merge your branch into the main branch, allowing for code review and discussion.  

## Best Practices  
- **Commit often**: Make small, frequent commits to track progress and make it easier to identify issues.  
- **Use descriptive commit messages**: Clearly describe the changes made and why, making it easier to understand the history of your project.  
- **Keep the main branch stable**: Only merge tested and stable code into the main branch to ensure that it remains deployable.

### 2. Version control for data using DVC  

## Overview  
DVC is a tool designed to handle large datasets, models, and machine learning pipelines. It integrates with Git to track data files without storing them directly in your Git repository.  

## Step-by-step guide  

**Step 1: Initialize DVC in your project**  

- **Set up DVC**  
    Initialize DVC in your Git repository:  
    ```bash
    dvc init
    git commit -m "Initialized DVC"
    ```  

- **Track large data files**  
    Use DVC to track datasets, models, and other large files:  
    ```bash
    dvc add data/raw-data.csv
    ```  
    This command tracks the `raw-data.csv` file with DVC and creates a `.dvc` file that is version controlled with Git.  

**Step 2: Manage ML pipelines**  

- **Define pipelines in `dvc.yaml`**  
    Create a `dvc.yaml` file to define your ML pipeline:  
    ```yaml
    stages:
        preprocess:
            cmd: python src/preprocess.py
            deps:
                - src/preprocess.py
                - data/raw-data.csv
            outs:
                - data/processed-data.csv
        train:
            cmd: python src/train.py
    ```  
    This file defines the stages of your pipeline, including dependencies and outputs, ensuring that each step is reproducible.  

- **Run and track pipelines**  
    Run your pipeline stages using DVC, which tracks the inputs, outputs, and commands:  
    ```bash
    dvc repro
    ```  
    This command reruns the pipeline, reproducing the results if any dependencies have changed.  

**Step 3: Use remote storage for data and models**  

- **Configure remote storage**  
    Add a remote storage location for your data and models (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive):  
    ```bash
    dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/path
    ```  

- **Push data to remote storage**  
    Push your tracked data files to the remote storage:  
    ```bash
    dvc push
    ```  
    This command uploads your data and model files to remote storage, making them accessible and versioned separately from your code.  

## Best Practices  
- **Version data alongside code**: Always commit DVC files (`.dvc` and `dvc.yaml`) to Git to ensure that your data versions align with your code versions.  
- **Use descriptive stage names**: Clearly name each stage in your `dvc.yaml` file so that your pipeline can be understood at a glance.  
- **Regularly push data**: Regularly push your data to remote storage to keep it safe and accessible to collaborators.

### 3. Version control for models  

## Overview  
Versioning your ML models is crucial for tracking different iterations and ensuring that the model you deploy is reproducible. You can use tools like DVC to manage model versions alongside your data and code.  

## Step-by-step guide  

**Step 1: Save model versions**  

- **Save model checkpoints**  
    Save your model at different stages of training, especially after significant improvements:  
    ```python
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(model, 'models/model_v1.pkl')
    ```  

- **Track models with DVC**  
    Use DVC to track model files, just like data files:  
    ```bash
    dvc add models/model_v1.pkl
    git add models/model_v1.pkl.dvc
    git commit -m "Tracked model version 1 with DVC"
    ```  

**Step 2: Deploy and reproduce specific model versions**  

- **Specify model versions in pipelines**  
    Ensure that your `dvc.yaml` pipeline specifies the exact model version used for each experiment:  
    ```yaml
    stages:
        deploy:
            cmd: python src/deploy.py --model models/model_v1.pkl
            deps:
                - src/deploy.py
                - models/model_v1.pkl
    ```  

- **Reproduce results with specific model versions**  
    When you need to reproduce results, use DVC to pull the specific model version from remote storage:  
    ```bash
    dvc pull models/model_v1.pkl
    ```  

## Best Practices  
- **Version every significant model**: Save and track new model versions whenever you make significant improvements or changes.  
- **Document model changes**: Keep a log of the changes made between model versions, including parameter tweaks, training data, and performance metrics.  
- **Align models with data and code**: Ensure that the model version is aligned with the exact versions of data and code used during training.

### 4. Integrating version control into your workflow  

## Combining Git and DVC  

- **Unified version control**  
    Use Git for version control of your code and DVC for your data and models to ensure that every component of your project is versioned and tracked together.  

**Example workflow:**  
- **Code**: Track and version your code using Git.  
- **Data**: Use DVC to track and version your datasets.  
- **Models**: Track and version your models using DVC, alongside your data and code.  

- **Reproducible pipelines**  
    Combine Git with DVC to create fully reproducible pipelines. Each stage of your pipeline should have version-controlled code, data, and models to ensure that anyone can reproduce your results exactly.  

## Collaboration and automation  

- **Collaboration**  
    Use Git and DVC to collaborate with others. Ensure that all team members have access to the same versions of data, code, and models.  
    Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines to automate the testing and validation of your code and models.  

- **Automation**  
    Integrate Git and DVC into your CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of running experiments, tracking results, and deploying models. This ensures that every step is reproducible and that you can easily revert to previous versions if needed.
