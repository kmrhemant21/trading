## Activity: Selecting an AI/ML Engineer for a Dummy Project

### Project Name: Customer Sentiment Analysis System

**Project Description:**  
Your company is developing a customer sentiment analysis system that uses AI and ML to analyze customer reviews, social media comments, and survey responses in real time. The system will provide insights into customer satisfaction, helping to improve products and services. You need to hire an AI/ML engineer who can contribute effectively to this project.

**Your Task:**  
As the hiring manager, your job is to review the resumes of three candidates and select the one who is best suited for this project. You will consider their technical skills, experience, and how well they align with the project’s needs. After making your decision, you will provide a brief justification for your choice.
