There’s no single “best” strategy—what works depends on your goals (frequency, instruments, risk tolerance) and your edge (data, execution speed, capital). That said, here’s a **robust, battle-tested template** you can start with, then adapt and refine:

---

## 1. Strategy Framework: Trend with Mean-Reversion Filter

1. **Primary Signal (Trend-Following)**

   * **Dual EMA Crossover** on your chosen timeframe (e.g. 5-min or 15-min bars):

     * **Fast EMA** (e.g. 8 period) crossing **above** **Slow EMA** (e.g. 21 period) → **enter long**
     * Fast EMA crossing **below** Slow EMA → **enter short**

2. **Filter (Mean-Reversion / Momentum)**

   * Require your **RSI(14)** to confirm:

     * For longs: RSI between 50 and 70 (avoiding overbought extremes)
     * For shorts: RSI between 30 and 50 (avoiding oversold extremes)
   * This reduces whipsaws in choppy sideways markets.

3. **Entry & Exit**

   * **Entry** at next bar open (or market if intraday) once both crossover + RSI condition align.
   * **Stop-Loss**: ATR-based (e.g. 1.5 × ATR(14)) or a fixed % (1 – 1.5%).
   * **Take-Profit**: Risk\:Reward ratio of 1:2, or trail your stop with a 1 × ATR trailing stop.

4. **Position Sizing & Risk Control**

   * **Fixed-fraction**: risk no more than 1 – 2% of account on any single trade.

     * E.g. if your stop is 1% away, buy/invest so that a 1% move = 1% of capital.
   * **Volatility scaling**: scale position size inversely to current realized volatility.

5. **Timeframe & Universe**

   * Choose a universe of **liquid futures or ETFs** (ES, NQ, Nifty futures, NiftyBees) to ensure low slippage.
   * Run on **5- or 15-min bars** for intraday, or daily bars for swing strategies.

## 2. Putting It All Together in Code

1. **Data Feed**: download OHLCV via `yfinance`, `Alpha Vantage`, or your broker’s API.
2. **Indicators**: compute EMA, RSI, ATR.
3. **Signal Logic**: implement the crossover + filter conditions.
4. **Broker Simulation**: use Backtrader/VectorBT to backtest with realistic commissions, slippage, and order types.
5. **Money Management**: calculate size per risk-percent rule.
6. **Backtest & Optimize**: grid-search EMA lengths, RSI bands, ATR‐multiplier for stops.
7. **Paper-Trade**: run live on a demo account for 2–4 weeks, compare to backtest.

## 3. Advanced Enhancements

* **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**: only take a 5-min crossover if the 1-hour trend (e.g. 20-hour EMA) is aligned.
* **Volume-Weighted Filters**: require above-average volume on entries.
* **Sentiment Overlay**: only go long if your news-sentiment model (e.g. FinBERT) is net positive for the stock/ETF.
* **Machine-Learning Ranking**: train a simple tree-based or neural model on engineered features (MA, RSI, momentum, volume, sentiment embeddings) to predict short-term returns, then only take your EMA signal when the ML model is bullish.

---

## 4. Risk & Execution

* **Stress-Test**: simulate shocks (e.g. 5% gap moves) and worst-case slippage.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: build alerts on drawdown, open P\&L, unfilled orders.
* **Kill-Switches**: if a strategy loses more than 5% in a day, turn it off until reviewed.

---

### Why This Works

* **Trend-following** captures sustained moves
* **Mean-reversion filter** tames noise
* **ATR stops** adapt to changing volatility
* **Fixed-fraction sizing** limits single-trade risk

That template has been applied profitably by countless systematic funds at intraday and daily horizons. **Your job** is to tailor the parameters and universe to your capital, data quality, and execution environment—then rigorously backtest, paper-trade, and monitor live. Good luck building your bot!
