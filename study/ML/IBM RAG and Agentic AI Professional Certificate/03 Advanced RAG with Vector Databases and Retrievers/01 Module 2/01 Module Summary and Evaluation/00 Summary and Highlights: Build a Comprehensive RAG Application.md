## Summary and Highlights: Build a Comprehensive RAG Application

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- **FAISS and Chroma DB are built for different goals**
- **FAISS gives you control over indexing, but lacks metadata and distribution by default**
- **Chroma DB is easier to deploy and supports metadata, but has fewer indexing options**
- **You can extend FAISS with Milvus for scalability and metadata**
- **You can extend both tools with LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG pipelines**
- **You should choose the right tool based on your project's size, complexity, and infrastructure**
