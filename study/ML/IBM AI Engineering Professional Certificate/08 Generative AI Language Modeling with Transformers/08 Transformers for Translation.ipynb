Whether it's for expanding business reach, accessing information in different languages, or connecting with people across the globe, language translation plays a crucial role. This is where transformer model for language translation lab steps in, letting you delve into the world of neural machine translation – a field at the forefront of overcoming language barriers. You'll explore how to implement a transformer model to translate text from one language to another.\n","\n","## Why transformers?\n","In the field of natural language processing (NLP), you often deal with sequential data, like sentences. Before transformers, the most common models used were Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. These models process data sequentially, meaning they read a sentence word by word, one after the other. This makes them slow and less efficient for long sequences. Also, RNNs and LSTMs can struggle to keep track of information from earlier in the sequence, which is vital in understanding context.\n","\n","Transformers introduced a new way of processing sequences. Instead of reading word by word in order, they can look at the entire sequence at once. This approach makes them faster and more efficient. They can also better understand the context of each word in a sentence, no matter how long it is.\n","\n","![translation](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-AI0201EN-Coursera/Translation.png)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"46f6c414-01ff-4239-80b8-d667303c3c6d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Setup\n","## Installing required libraries\n","Before you start, let's make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed.
