# Summary and Highlights: Using Built-in Agents in LangChain

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- You can analyze and visualize data by asking natural language questions to the Pandas DataFrame agent, which instantly generates code and returns clear data insights.

- The agent-generated Python code directly interacts with your DataFrame, filtering, aggregating, and visualizing data based on your natural language prompts.

- Always use sandboxed environments, design clear prompts, validate LLM analysis with human expertise, and iteratively refine your queries for safe and effective AI-driven data analysis.

- AI-powered SQL agents provide a broader range of users with the ability to access and interpret data without the need for deep technical skills. To build apps that enable natural language processing, set up a development environment with an LLM, SQL database, and LangChainâ€™s SQL agent to handle natural language queries.

- To run a query, you use a natural language query along with the SQL agent, which translates the query to SQL and retrieves results from the database.

- To develop applications that use natural language processing, you can begin by creating a Python virtual environment. Then, install the required libraries, including LangChain, install your LLMs, launch the SQL server, and build a database connector for LangChain.
