# Discussion: Curating information on ethics

## Discussion prompt
In this discussion, you will explore how ethical principles in AI development are learned and applied. Reflect on your experiences, and answer one or more of the following questions:

- What are your go-to platforms, organizations, or resources for staying informed on ethical guidelines and best practices? For example, do you rely on LinkedIn, academic journals, industry conferences, or specific websites?

- Who are the thought leaders in your country, state, or industry that you follow to gain insights into ethical AI practices? How have their ideas influenced your understanding?

- How do you evaluate the credibility and relevance of the ethical information you consume? What criteria do you use to determine whether a resource or individual is trustworthy?

- In what ways have you implemented the ethical insights or guidelines you've learned into your professional or academic projects? Share specific examples if possible.

## Instructions
Write a post between 150 and 300 words, addressing these questions.

Be specific, and provide examples where possible.

After posting, respond to at least two of your peers' posts, offering feedback or expanding on their ideas. Consider sharing additional resources, posing follow-up questions, or discussing different perspectives on curating and applying ethical principles in AI/ML.

## Example post
To stay informed on ethical AI practices, I often turn to academic journals such as Nature Machine Intelligence and platforms such as LinkedIn, where thought leaders frequently share articles and case studies. For example, I follow Timnit Gebru, whose work on bias in AI has significantly influenced my approach to data collection and model evaluation. I evaluate resources by checking for citations, the credibility of the publisher, and the author's expertise in the field. Recently, I implemented ethical guidelines in a project by applying Explainable AI  techniques to ensure the transparency of predictions in a healthcare application. This approach allowed the team to present interpretable results to clinicians, fostering trust in the system's decisions.
