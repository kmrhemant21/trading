# Fine-tuning techniques

## Introduction

Fine-tuning a pretrained large language model (LLM) for domain-specific tasks is a powerful method for building specialized AI systems. This guide focuses on adapting a model for customer service queries in the finance sector. The process involves understanding the task, collecting relevant data, preprocessing it, and fine-tuning the model to classify financial inquiries with accuracy and precision.

By the end of this reading, you will be able to:

- Define task-specific requirements for fine-tuning an LLM.
- Collect and preprocess a relevant dataset for domain-specific applications.
- Implement fine-tuning of a pretrained model for customer service in the finance domain.
- Evaluate and optimize the fine-tuned model for better performance.

## Step-by-step guide to fine-tuning an LLM

This reading will guide you through the following steps:

1. Step 1: Understand the task
2. Step 2: Collect the dataset
3. Step 3: Preprocess the data
4. Step 4: Fine-tune the pretrained model
5. Step 5: Evaluate the fine-tuned model
6. Step 6: Optimize the fine-tuned model

### Step 1: Understand the task

The first step in fine-tuning a model is understanding the task and the domain. In this case, we'll focus on fine-tuning a model to handle customer service queries specific to the finance sector. The task may involve classifying customer inquiries into categories such as account information, loan requests, and transaction disputes.

- Task definition: customer service query classification
- Domain: finance

### Step 2: Collect the dataset

To fine-tune the model effectively, you will need a dataset that reflects the specific language and terminology used in the finance domain. You can either use publicly available datasets or collect proprietary data specific to your organization. For this course, a dataset of customer queries from the finance industry will be provided to ensure that learners can follow along with the fine-tuning process.

#### Example of data collection

A dataset of anonymized customer service interactions is labeled with categories such as "Account Inquiry," "Loan Application," and "Fraud Report." Data can be sourced from customer support logs, call center transcripts, and web chat interactions.

#### Learner access note

A similar anonymized dataset will be made available to learners to facilitate hands-on practice. This will allow you to follow along with the examples and apply the fine-tuning techniques discussed in this course.

### Step 3: Preprocess the data

Preprocessing is critical for preparing the data for fine-tuning. The text needs to be cleaned and tokenized before being fed into the model. Preprocessing steps include:

- Text cleaning: removing any irrelevant information (e.g., numbers and special characters) and standardizing terms.
- Tokenization: splitting the text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, depending on the model's requirements.

#### Text cleaning example 

In finance, certain tokens, such as currency symbols or numerical values, might be more significant than in other domains. As such, we handle those tokens carefully during cleaning:

```python
import re

# Custom function to clean finance-related text
def clean_finance_text(text):
    text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
    text = re.sub(r'\d+', '[NUM]', text)  # Replace numbers with [NUM]
    text = re.sub(r'\$+', '[CURRENCY]', text)  # Replace currency symbols with a placeholder
    return text
```

### Step 4: Fine-tune the pretrained model

After the data is cleaned and tokenized, we can begin the fine-tuning process. We use a pretrained language model, such as BERT or GPT, which has already been trained on a large general-purpose corpus. Fine-tuning this model on our specific finance dataset will help it adapt to the unique terminology and structure of customer service inquiries in this domain.

#### Steps for fine-tuning

1. Load the pretrained model and the corresponding tokenizer.
2. Prepare the data by converting the text into a format that the model can process.
3. Set up the training process by defining hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.

#### Code example for fine-tuning

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load the pretrained BERT model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

# Initialize the Trainer for fine-tuning
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_data,
    eval_dataset=val_data,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### Step 5: Evaluate the fine-tuned model

After fine-tuning, evaluating the model's performance on a test set is essential to ensure it can generalize to new data and perform well on unseen examples. Standard evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. If these metrics are unfamiliar, here's a brief explanation:

- **Accuracy**: the proportion of correctly classified examples out of the total examples.
- **Precision**: the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **F1 score**: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure that balances both.

#### How these metrics are used for evaluation

In the context of customer service query classification in the finance sector, these metrics help determine how well the fine-tuned model performs. For example:

- Accuracy tells us the overall effectiveness of the model in classifying financial queries.
- Precision is crucial to avoid misclassifying sensitive categories such as "Fraud Report."
- Recall helps ensure that important categories (such as loan applications) are captured.
- F1 score balances precision and recall to provide a more comprehensive evaluation, especially when the classes are imbalanced (e.g., fewer fraud reports than account inquiries).

#### Learner action

In this step, learners must evaluate their fine-tuned model using these metrics. By doing so, they can understand their model's strengths and weaknesses and identify areas for improvement. Learners will use these metrics to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize their model's performance.

#### Evaluation example

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test set
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results['eval_accuracy']}")
```

### Step 6: Optimize the fine-tuned model

Once the initial fine-tuning is complete, several methods exist to further improve the model's performance. One of the most effective methods is fine-tuning the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. By experimenting with these values, you can optimize the model's performance for the specific task.

During the training phase, the model's weights are adjusted based on the input data (in this case, customer queries in the finance domain) and the corresponding labels (e.g., "Account Inquiry," "Loan Application," and "Fraud Report"). The model makes predictions, and the difference between the predictions and the actual labels is calculated using a loss function, which measures how well the model performs. The optimizer then adjusts the model's weights to minimize the loss function, improving the model's accuracy over time.

Hyperparameter tuning is finding the best settings for parameters not learned directly by the model during training (such as learning rate or batch size). These parameters affect how the training proceeds:

- **Learning rate**: this controls how much the model weights should be adjusted regarding the loss gradient. A high learning rate might cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a too-low rate can result in very slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima.
- **Batch size**: this refers to the number of training examples used to calculate the gradients before updating the model's weights. Smaller batch sizes can lead to noisy updates, but they often generalize better. Larger batch sizes offer smoother updates but might require more memory and computation.
- **Number of epochs**: the number of times the model sees the entire training dataset. More epochs can lead to better learning, but too many might cause overfitting, in which the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data.

#### Hyperparameter tuning example

```python
# Use hyperparameter search to find the best settings
best_model = trainer.hyperparameter_search(
    direction="maximize",
    n_trials=10
)
```

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning a pretrained model for a domain-specific task allows you to create highly specialized AI systems that excel in particular industries. By using a domain-specific dataset and following the steps outlined here, you can adapt any general-purpose language model to meet the needs of your specialized tasksâ€”whether it's customer service, legal document processing, or health care.
