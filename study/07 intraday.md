To design a daily trading bot (intraday strategy), youâ€™ll need a clearly defined strategy that's systematic, repeatable, and quantifiable. Here is a structured approach you can follow:

---

## âœ… Step 1: Define your objective and constraints

**Objective:**

* Intraday trades (buy and sell within the same trading day).
* Target modest yet consistent returns.

**Constraints:**

* Risk management (max daily loss, stop-loss).
* Capital allocation (e.g., only 2-5% risk per trade).

---

## âœ… Step 2: Select instruments

For intraday trading, prefer highly liquid instruments:

* **Stocks:**
  Select highly liquid stocks (e.g., Reliance, TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank).
* **Indices (Futures & Options):**
  NIFTY, BANK NIFTY (very liquid and popular).
* **ETFs:**
  Liquid ETFs like NIFTYBEES.

## âœ… Step 3: Recommended Intraday Strategies

Here are popular strategies suitable for intraday automation:

| Strategy                         | Description                                                                                          | Indicators Required         |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **EMA + RSI**                    | Buy when EMA crossover bullish and RSI oversold. Sell when EMA crossover bearish and RSI overbought. | EMA(9, 21), RSI(14)         |
| **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** | Trade in the direction of breakout from the initial 15-min range.                                    | 15-min candlestick data     |
| **VWAP Strategy**                | Buy when price moves above VWAP with rising volume. Sell below VWAP.                                 | VWAP, Volume                |
| **Bollinger Bands**              | Buy near lower band, sell near upper band.                                                           | Bollinger Bands (20-period) |
| **Pivot Points**                 | Trade price action around daily pivot, R1, R2, S1, S2 levels.                                        | Daily Pivot Points          |

## âœ… Recommended Strategy: EMA + RSI Intraday Strategy

*This strategy is popular due to simplicity and effectiveness.*

**Buy Entry:**

* 9-period EMA crosses above 21-period EMA
* RSI(14) > 50 (momentum confirmation)

**Sell Entry:**

* 9-period EMA crosses below 21-period EMA
* RSI(14) < 50 (momentum confirmation)

**Exit Criteria:**

* Set a fixed percentage profit (e.g., 0.5-1%) or use opposite signal for exit.
* Hard stop-loss (0.5% loss limit recommended).

---

## âœ… Step 4: Technical Implementation with Python

You can easily automate trades using Python.

**Core Libraries/Platforms:**

* **Broker APIs:** Zerodha Kite Connect, Groww API
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib, Yfinance, CCXT (crypto)

### Pseudo-Code (EMA + RSI strategy):

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import ta

# Fetch Data
data = fetch_intraday_data('TCS') # your custom function to get data

# Calculate Indicators
data['EMA9'] = ta.trend.ema_indicator(data['Close'], window=9)
data['EMA21'] = ta.trend.ema_indicator(data['Close'], window=21)
data['RSI'] = ta.momentum.rsi(data['Close'], window=14)

# Generate Buy/Sell Signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[(data['EMA9'] > data['EMA21']) & (data['RSI'] > 50), 'Signal'] = 1
data.loc[(data['EMA9'] < data['EMA21']) & (data['RSI'] < 50), 'Signal'] = -1

# Execute Trades
if data['Signal'].iloc[-1] == 1:
    place_buy_order(...)
elif data['Signal'].iloc[-1] == -1:
    place_sell_order(...)
```

---

## âœ… Step 5: Risk Management

Always include clear risk controls:

* **Position sizing:** 2-5% of capital per trade.
* **Stop-losses:** Mandatory (0.5-1% intraday recommended).
* **Daily limits:** Stop trading after hitting daily loss limits.

---

## âœ… Step 6: Backtesting and Optimization

Backtest your strategy on historical intraday data:

* **Tools:** Zipline, Backtrader, Pyfolio, custom Pandas scripts.
* **Performance Metrics:**

  * Profit factor
  * Sharpe ratio
  * Win/Loss ratio
  * Maximum drawdown

```python
# Example with Backtrader
import backtrader as bt

class EMARSI(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.ema9 = bt.ind.EMA(period=9)
        self.ema21 = bt.ind.EMA(period=21)
        self.rsi = bt.ind.RSI(period=14)

    def next(self):
        if not self.position:
            if self.ema9 > self.ema21 and self.rsi > 50:
                self.buy()
            elif self.ema9 < self.ema21 and self.rsi < 50:
                self.sell()
        else:
            if self.position.size > 0 and (self.ema9 < self.ema21):
                self.close()
            elif self.position.size < 0 and (self.ema9 > self.ema21):
                self.close()
```

---

## âœ… Step 7: Deployment & Monitoring

Deploy on cloud or dedicated server:

* Cloud: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
* Local deployment: Dockerize your Python application for ease of use.
* Continuous monitoring & logging (alerts, Telegram notifications).

---

## âœ… Step 8: Legal and Compliance

Ensure you adhere to regulations by SEBI (India):

* Use registered APIs provided by brokers (Zerodha, Groww, Upstox).
* Avoid any form of market manipulation.
* Always ensure accurate reporting of trades for taxation.

---

## âœ… Bonus: Advanced ML Integration

Future scope for advanced strategies using machine learning (optional):

* Classification Models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost)
* Regression Models (predictive price movement)
* Time Series models (LSTM, Prophet)
* Sentiment analysis (news, social media)

---

## ðŸš© **Final Recommendation:**

Start simple (EMA + RSI or ORB), perfect your process, and then incrementally include complexity and ML/AI-driven models. Always prioritize **robust risk management** and **proper backtesting**.
