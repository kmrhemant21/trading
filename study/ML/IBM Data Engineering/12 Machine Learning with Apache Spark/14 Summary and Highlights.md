# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. In this module, you learned:

- **Spark** is a distributed computing system that handles large-scale data sets efficiently.

- Data engineers benefit from various features provided by Spark, which aid in creating scalable and effective data processing pipelines.

- With Spark's distributed computing approach, in-memory processing capabilities, and APIs, data engineers can tackle complex data structures and work with massive datasets.

- **Classification** using Spark ML is the task of predicting categorical labels or classes for a given set of features.

- Classification algorithms can be applied in various domains, such as:
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Spam detection
    - Fraud detection
    - Image classification

- **Regression**, using Spark ML, involves building and training regression models using the machine learning libraries offered by Spark.

- Regression algorithms enable the creation of models that predict continuous target variables using input features.

- **Clustering**, powered by Spark ML, involves grouping similar data points into clusters based on shared characteristics or patterns.

- Classification algorithms are well-suited for applications like:
    - Customer segmentation
    - Anomaly detection
    - Image segmentation
    - Recommendation systems

- **K-means algorithm** instance specifies the number of clusters (k) and a random seed for reproducibility.

- **GraphFrames**, integrated with Apache Spark, enables graph processing using DataFrames.

- It provides separate DataFrames for graph vertices and edges, which can be analyzed with SparkSQL.

- GraphFrames also includes popular built-in graph algorithms that can be applied to the edge and vertex DataFrames for various analysis tasks.
