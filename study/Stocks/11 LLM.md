A robust Generative-AI–driven entry strategy blends classical technical signals with real-time context (news, social sentiment, etc.) and leverages an LLM as a “signal adjudicator.” Below is a blueprint you can adapt:

---

## 1. Strategy Overview

1. **Feature Fusion**

   * **Technical Indicators** (e.g. EMA crossover, RSI, VWAP, ATR volatility)
   * **Contextual Signals** (news headlines sentiment, Twitter buzz, option‐flow)
2. **GenAI “Judge”**

   * Feed a concise summary of your fused features into an LLM prompt
   * Ask it to output “LONG”, “SHORT” or “NO ENTRY” plus a confidence score
3. **Execution Rule**

   * **Enter** only when LLM’s confidence > threshold (e.g. 0.75) *and* technical filter agrees
   * **Reject** or “NO ENTRY” otherwise

## 2. Key Components

| Component           | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Pipeline**   | Ingest minute-level OHLCV + streaming news/Twitter API             |
| **Feature Engine**  | Compute EMA(20/50), RSI(14), ATR(14), sentiment score, etc.        |
| **Prompt Template** | Structured JSON with named fields for each feature                 |
| **LLM Endpoint**    | ChatGPT-style model (e.g. GPT-4-Turbo) with a custom system prompt |
| **Signal Combiner** | Applies final rule: LLM\_confidence > threshold **and** EMA filter |
| **Risk Manager**    | Position sizing, stop-loss via ATR, max drawdown limits            |

## 3. Example Prompt & Pseudocode

```python
# (1) compute your features
features = {
  "price": {"open": 150.2, "high": 151.8, "low": 149.5, "close": 151.0},
  "EMA20": 150.6, "EMA50": 150.1,
  "RSI14": 62.4, "ATR14": 0.8,
  "sentiment": 0.15  # +0.15 = slightly positive
}

# (2) craft your prompt
prompt = f"""
You are a disciplined trading assistant. Given the following market snapshot:
{features}

Based on standard technical and sentiment analysis:
— Should we ENTER a trade now? (Answer LONG, SHORT, or NO ENTRY).
— Provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.
Respond in JSON:
{{"signal":"", "confidence":0.00}}
"""

# (3) call the LLM
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role":"system", "content":"You are a precise, no-fluff trading assistant."},
    {"role":"user",   "content": prompt}
  ]
)
result = response.choices[0].message.content
signal, conf = parse_json(result)

# (4) apply your rule
if signal == "LONG" and conf > 0.75 and features["EMA20"] > features["EMA50"]:
    enter_long()
elif signal == "SHORT" and conf > 0.75 and features["EMA20"] < features["EMA50"]:
    enter_short()
else:
    pass  # No entry
```

---

## 4. Risk Management

* **Stop-Loss**: Set at 1 × ATR below entry for longs (above entry for shorts).
* **Position Sizing**: Risk max 0.5–1% of capital per trade.
* **Max Concurrent Trades**: 1–2 to limit overexposure.

---

## 5. Backtesting & Refinement

1. **Historical Replay**: Run your pipeline over past 6–12 months of intraday data.
2. **Metrics**: Track win rate, average R-multiple, maximum drawdown.
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust LLM confidence cutoff (e.g. 0.70–0.85) to optimize Sharpe ratio.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Refine system/user prompt to reduce ambiguity and “hallucinations.”

---

### Why This Works

* **Context-Aware**: The LLM digests both numeric and textual context.
* **Adaptive**: You can retrain/fine-tune your prompt on new market regimes.
* **Explainable**: You get a confidence score and, if desired, can ask the LLM “Why?”

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Prototype the above in a Jupyter notebook.
2. Backtest on 1-minute SPY data for at least 3 months.
3. Review edge-cases where the LLM disagrees with your technical filter.
4. Iterate on your prompt and threshold.

This fusion of classical TA with generative AI “judgment” tends to outperform pure-tech or pure-sentiment approaches, because you’re harnessing the LLM’s ability to contextualize subtleties in real time.
