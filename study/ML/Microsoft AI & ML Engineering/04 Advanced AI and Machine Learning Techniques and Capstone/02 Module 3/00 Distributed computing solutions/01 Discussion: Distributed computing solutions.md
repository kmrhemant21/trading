# Discussion: Distributed computing solutions

## Discussion prompt 

Reflect on your experience with the practice activity where you evaluated use cases for distributed computing. Use the following guiding questions to shape your response, but feel free to explore other aspects of your insights:

- **Surprising outcomes**: were there any use cases where the suitability (or lack thereof) for distributed computing surprised you? If so, which ones, and why did they stand out?

- **Key considerations**: how did factors such as expense, deployment complexity, and security influence your decisions? Do you think these factors are equally important across all scenarios, or do they vary in significance?

- **Cost versus benefit**: in your opinion, when does the expense of implementing distributed computing outweigh its benefits? Provide examples or scenarios to support your view.

- **Real-world implications**: how do you think organizations balance technical feasibility with practical constraints, such as budget and expertise, when considering distributed computing solutions?

## Instructions

- **Be specific**: clearly describe your thoughts on key aspects, such as surprising outcomes or challenges, and how factors such as cost and complexity influenced your decisions.

- **Explain your perspective**: reflect on the practical and technical considerations of distributed computing, and support your reasoning with examples or insights gained during the activity.

- **Suggest improvements or best practices**: offer recommendations or ideas for optimizing the decision-making process when evaluating distributed computing solutions in real-world scenarios.

This reflection will help you and your peers critically evaluate the role of distributed computing in solving complex challenges, fostering a deeper understanding of its technical, practical, and organizational dimensions.
