Gartner defines DataOps as a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration, and automation of data flows between data managers and consumers across an organization. DataOps aims to create predictable delivery and change management of data, data models, and related artifacts. DataOps uses technology to automate data delivery with the appropriate levels of security, quality, and metadata to improve the use and value of data in a dynamic environment.

A small team working on a simpler or limited number of use cases can meet business requirements efficiently. As data pipelines and data infrastructures get more complex, and data teams and consumers grow in size, you need development processes and efficient collaboration between teams to govern the data and analytics lifecycle. From data ingestion and data processing to analytics and reporting, you need to reduce data defects, ensure shorter cycle times, and ensure 360-degree access to quality data for all stakeholders.

DataOps helps you achieve this through metadata management, workflow and test automation, code repositories, collaboration tools, and orchestration to help manage complex tasks and workflows. Using the DataOps methodology ensures all activities occur in the right order with the right security permissions. It helps establish a continual process that allows you to cut wastages, streamline steps, automate processes, increase throughput, and improve continually.

According to Gartner, DataOps represents a collaborative approach to data management that enhances communication, integration, and automation of data flows between data managers and consumers throughout an organization. The methodology focuses on creating predictable delivery and change management for data, data models, and associated artifacts while leveraging technology to automate data delivery with proper security, quality, and metadata controls to maximize data value in dynamic environments.

Smaller teams handling limited use cases can efficiently satisfy business requirements. However, as data pipelines and infrastructure become increasingly complex and data teams expand, organizations require structured development processes and effective team collaboration to manage the complete data and analytics lifecycle. This spans from data ingestion through processing to analytics and reporting, requiring reduced data defects, faster cycle times, and comprehensive access to quality data for all stakeholders.

DataOps facilitates this through:
- Metadata management systems
- Workflow and test automation
- Code repository management
- Collaboration platforms
- Orchestration tools for complex task management

The DataOps methodology ensures proper sequencing of activities with appropriate security controls, establishing continuous processes that eliminate waste, streamline operations, automate workflows, boost throughput, and drive ongoing improvements.

Leading DataOps platforms include IBM DataOps, Nexla, Switchboard, StreamSets, and Infoworks.

## DataOps Methodology Framework

The DataOps Methodology enables organizations to implement repeatable processes for building and deploying analytics and data pipelines. Successful adoption allows organizations to understand, trust, and leverage data for value creation.

This approach ensures that data used in problem-solving and decision-making is relevant, reliable, and traceable, improving the likelihood of achieving desired business outcomes by addressing inefficiencies in data access, preparation, integration, and availability.

The methodology comprises three core phases:

1. **Establish DataOps Phase** - Provides organizational setup guidance for effective data management
2. **Iterate DataOps Phase** - Delivers data for defined sprint cycles
3. **Improve DataOps Phase** - Channels learnings from each sprint into continuous process improvement

## Benefits of DataOps Implementation

Organizations adopting DataOps methodology can better organize, secure, and trust their data assets by:

- **Automating metadata management** and cataloging data assets for improved accessibility
- **Establishing data lineage** for credibility verification and compliance requirements
- **Automating data lifecycle workflows** to maintain data integrity, relevance, and security
- **Optimizing processes** to meet data access and delivery requirements efficiently
- **Maintaining business-ready pipelines** available to all consumers and stakeholders
- **Fostering data-driven culture** through automation, quality controls, and governance

For data practitioners, the methodology reduces development time, eliminates redundancies, increases productivity and throughput, and ensures optimal data quality output.

DataOps enables enhanced collaboration between data professionals, consumers, and stakeholders toward creating valuable business insights. While implementation requires systematic change, time, and resources, it ultimately makes data and analytics more efficient and reliable.

Additionally, DataOps creates new career opportunities, including DataOps Engineer roles focused on development and deployment lifecycles. With experience, professionals can advance to specialized positions involving data strategy definition, business process development and deployment, performance metrics establishment, and performance measurement.
