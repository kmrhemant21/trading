# Summary and Highlights: Building Apps with RAG

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

- **Gradio** is an open-source Python library for creating customizable web-based user interfaces, particularly for machine learning models and computational tools.

- Gradio allows you to create interfaces for machine-learning models with just a few lines of code. It supports various inputs and outputs, such as text, images, Ô¨Åles, and more.

- Gradio interfaces can be shared with others through unique URLs, facilitating easy collaboration and feedback collection.

- Setting up a Gradio interface comprises four steps: writing Python code, creating an interface, launching the web server, and accessing the web interface.

- The key features of Gradio include `gr.Textbox` for text input/output, `gr.Number` for numeric inputs, and `gr.File` for file uploads, enabling multiple file selections.

- Once deployed, users can interact with the interface in real time via a web link.
