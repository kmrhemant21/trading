You'll learn how to create custom tools that enable an LLM to perform specific actions, from extracting video IDs to fetching YouTube transcripts and metadata. Through hands-on examples, you'll first implement manual tool calling to understand the underlying mechanics, then build a flexible YouTube interaction system that can search videos, extract transcripts, fetch trending content, and generate summaries. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to construct both fixed-sequence and recursive tool-calling chains, allowing your AI assistants to dynamically decide which tools to use and when to use them, creating truly intelligent agents that can reason about and interact with the world around them.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"df673e75-279a-4b2d-8205-4584bd26f594","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","   <li><a

Not only are you required to store the output of each tool, but you also need to store state information like tool IDs. To do this effectively, you must ensure the output of each tool can be properly passed to the next step in your pipeline. The RunnablePassthrough component allows you to maintain state throughout the chain while adding or transforming data at each step, making it ideal for connecting your various tools into a cohesive workflow.\n","The RunnableLambda, placed at the end of your chain, serves a different purpose - it extracts only the final result you want to present to the user. After all the tool calls and message processing, you have a rich state object with many fields, but the user typically only needs the final answer. The RunnableLambda transforms this complete state into just the information you want to return.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"f56207c0-f692-47ba-a25d-7718b876483d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableLambda\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e3bbddd0-d72d-497d-ab46-745bce0aa1f1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Building the summarization chain\n","\n","Now, you'll combine your functions into a complete `summarization_chain` using the pipe operator `|`, which applies functions sequentially (similar to function composition where `f|g(x)` is equivalent to `f(g(x))`).\n","\n","The workflow follows these steps:\n","1.
