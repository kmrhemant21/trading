# Install ta-lib on macOS

/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install ta-lib
git clone https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python.git
cd ta-lib-python
export TA_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/include"

# Notes on Homebrew Prefixes for macOS M1/M2 (Apple Silicon) vs. Rosetta 2 (Intel)

**Key Distinction**  
- **/usr/local**  
 - Used by the Intel (x86_64) Homebrew installation under Rosetta 2.  
  - Packages installed here are built for Intel architecture and run via Rosetta 2 translation on Apple Silicon.  
  - Example path: `/usr/local/Cellar/ta-lib/0.6.4/...`  

- **/opt/homebrew**  
  - Used by the native Apple Silicon (arm64) Homebrew installation.  
  - Packages installed here are built for ARM64 and run natively on M1/M2 chips.  
  - Example path: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/ta-lib/0.6.4/...`  

## Why It Matters  
1. **Architecture Compatibility**  
   - Mixing libraries from `/usr/local` (x86_64) with a native ARM64 Python/C extensions leads to “incompatible architecture” errors.  
   - Always ensure both your interpreter and libraries share the same architecture.  

2. **Parallel Installations**  
   - Homebrew supports two independent prefixes on Apple Silicon:
     - `/usr/local` for Rosetta (Intel)  
     - `/opt/homebrew` for ARM64  
   - The `brew` executable you invoke depends on your PATH order and how you launch it (with or without `arch -arm64`).  

3. **Path and Environment Configuration**  
   - To use ARM64 Homebrew by default, put `/opt/homebrew/bin` at the front of your PATH:
     ```bash
     export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
     ```
   - Verify with:
     ```bash
     which brew        # /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
     brew --prefix     # /opt/homebrew
     ```

4. **Installing and Reinstalling Packages**  
   - **Intel/Rosetta install**  
     ```bash
     /usr/local/bin/brew uninstall ta-lib
     arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install ta-lib
     ```
   - **Native ARM64 install**  
     ```bash
     arch -arm64 brew install ta-lib
     ```

5. **Building Native Extensions**  
   - Always point your build environment to the correct prefix:
     ```bash
     export TA_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/include"
     export TA_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ta-lib/lib"
     ```
   - Clean any previous artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.so`) before rebuilding:
     ```bash
     rm -rf build/ dist/ talib/*.so
     arch -arm64 python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
     arch -arm64 python3 setup.py install
     ```

## Troubleshooting Tips  
- **“File not found” under `/opt/homebrew`**  
  - Indicates package is still in `/usr/local`. Reinstall under ARM64 as shown above.  
- **“Ignoring file … found architecture 'x86_64'; required 'arm64'”**  
  - Linker is picking up Intel library. Confirm `TA_LIBRARY_PATH` points to `/opt/homebrew`.  
- **Persistent PATH issues**  
  - Ensure no stray references to `/usr/local/bin` precede `/opt/homebrew/bin` in your shell profile.

### Summary  
Maintain clear separation of Intel versus ARM64 Homebrew installations by controlling your PATH, using explicit `arch` commands, and always pointing build tools to the correct include/library directories. This prevents architecture mismatches and ensures smooth installation of native extensions on M1/M2 Macs.
