# Practice Activity: Selecting an appropriate framework for a complex business issue

## Introduction

In this activity, you will analyze a complex business issue, evaluate the specific requirements, and select the most appropriate ML framework from four provided options: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning SDK. This exercise will help you apply the concepts you've learned about model development frameworks and develop your ability to make informed decisions in real-world scenarios.

## Scenario

**Business issue:** Predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service

You are working as a data scientist for a company that provides subscription-based services, such as online streaming, software as a service (SaaS), or digital content delivery. The company has been experiencing a higher-than-expected churn rate, with a significant number of customers canceling their subscriptions after only a few months. Your task is to build an ML model that can predict which customers are likely to churn, so the marketing team can target these customers with retention campaigns.

The data you have access to includes:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
- Service usage metrics (frequency of use, duration of sessions, features used)
- Customer support interactions (number of support tickets, resolution time, customer satisfaction scores)
- Historical churn data (whether a customer churned in the past, and if so, when)

The company’s goal is to reduce churn by at least 20 percent over the next quarter.

## Framework options

### TensorFlow

**Strengths:** Best suited for deep learning tasks, particularly when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data such as images, text, or sequential data. It offers extensive support for neural networks, allowing for sophisticated modeling.

**Considerations:** TensorFlow can be more complex to set up and manage, especially if your team is less experienced with deep learning frameworks.

### PyTorch

**Strengths:** Known for its flexibility and ease of use, particularly in research and prototyping. PyTorch is well suited for projects that require dynamic computation graphs, such as those involving Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or complex custom models.

**Considerations:** While PyTorch is excellent for experimentation and development, it may require more effort to deploy and scale in a production environment compared to some other frameworks.

### Scikit-learn

**Strengths:** Ideal for traditional ML tasks, including regression, classification, and clustering. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of algorithms and is easy to use, making it suitable for projects that require fast implementation and interpretation.

**Considerations:** Scikit-learn may not be the best choice for very large datasets or for tasks requiring deep learning, as it lacks the advanced neural network capabilities of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### Azure Machine Learning SDK

**Strengths:** Highly integrated with the Azure ecosystem, making it an excellent choice for projects that require scalable deployment, automated machine learning (AutoML), and robust model management. It’s also suitable for teams already using Azure for data storage and processing.

**Considerations:** Azure Machine Learning SDK is most powerful when used within the Azure environment, which may require additional costs and infrastructure setup.

## Activity instructions

1. **Analyze the business issue**
    - Review the details of the business issue and the available data.
    - Identify the key requirements for the ML model, including accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

2. **Evaluate the framework options**
    - Consider each framework's strengths and weaknesses in relation to the business issue.
    - Think about the type of model you need to develop (e.g., traditional machine learning vs. deep learning) and the specific features of the data you’ll be working with.

3. **Select the most appropriate framework**
    - Based on your analysis, choose the framework you believe is best suited for predicting customer churn in this scenario.
    - Justify your selection by explaining why you chose this framework over the others, considering factors such as data complexity, team expertise, and deployment needs.

4. **Document your decision**
    - Write a brief report (two to three paragraphs) summarizing your decision-making process and the rationale behind your chosen framework.
    - Include any assumptions you made and explain how they influenced your decision.

## Additional considerations

- Think about the long-term implications of your framework choice, including how easy it will be to maintain and update the model over time.
- Consider the available resources and expertise within your team—does your team have the skills to implement and manage the chosen framework effectively?

## Conclusion

By completing this activity, you will gain practical experience in evaluating and selecting an ML framework based on real-world business requirements. This exercise will enhance your ability to make strategic decisions in AI/ML projects, preparing you for similar challenges in your professional career.
