# Practice activity: Selecting a framework for a phantom project

## Introduction
In this activity, you will apply the knowledge you've gained about ML frameworks by selecting the most appropriate framework for a specific phantom project. This exercise is designed to simulate real-world decision-making processes. By the end of this activity, you will be able to choose the best tool for the job. Your selection should be based on the project requirements, and you will need to justify your choice.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Analyze project requirements for a real-world AI/ML solution.
- Select the most appropriate ML framework based on criteria such as real-time processing, scalability, flexibility, and long-term maintenance.
- Justify your selection with clear reasoning and alignment to the project goals.

## Phantom project scenario

**Project name:** SmartCity Traffic Optimization

**Project overview:** You have been hired by a city’s transportation department to develop an ML solution that optimizes traffic flow across the city. The goal is to reduce congestion, minimize travel times, and improve overall traffic management by predicting traffic patterns and adjusting traffic signals in real time.

## Project requirements

### Real-time data processing

- The system must process and analyze data from various sources, including live traffic cameras, GPS data from vehicles, and historical traffic data.
- Real-time predictions and adjustments are critical to ensure smooth traffic flow.

### Scalability

- The solution must handle large volumes of data from thousands of sensors and devices across the city.
- The system should scale as the city expands or as more data sources are added.

### Integration with existing infrastructure

- The ML model needs to integrate with the city’s existing traffic management systems, which include databases, APIs, and legacy software.
- The system must be able to send real-time signals to traffic lights and digital signage.

### Flexibility for experimentation

- The project will involve experimenting with different models and architectures to find the optimal solution.
- The framework should allow for rapid prototyping and easy iteration.

### Long-term maintenance and support

- The solution will be maintained and updated over several years, requiring a framework that has strong community support, extensive documentation, and ongoing updates.

## Activity instructions

### Step-by-step guide:
**Step 1: Review the project requirements**  
Carefully read through the project requirements for the SmartCity Traffic Optimization project. Consider each requirement and how it might influence your framework selection.

**Step 2: Research framework options**  
Based on the project needs, research the available ML frameworks—such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. Reflect on their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for each aspect of the project.

- **TensorFlow:** Known for its scalability, production readiness, and extensive ecosystem. It’s particularly strong in handling large-scale, real-time applications and integrating with various deployment environments.
- **PyTorch:** Favored for its flexibility and ease of use in experimentation. PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph allows for rapid iteration and testing, making it a good choice for projects involving a lot of experimentation.
- **Scikit-learn:** Excellent for traditional ML tasks with well-structured data. While it’s easy to use and integrates well with the Python ecosystem, it might not be the best choice for handling large-scale, real-time data.

**Step 3: Select the framework**  
Choose the framework you believe is best suited for the SmartCity Traffic Optimization project. Your selection should be based on the criteria provided in the project overview, such as real-time data processing, scalability, integration, flexibility, and long-term maintenance.

**Step 4: Justify your selection**  
Write a brief justification (approximately 250–300 words) explaining why you chose the particular framework. Consider the following points in your justification:

- How does the framework address the real-time data processing needs?
- What makes the framework scalable for handling large volumes of data?
- How will the framework integrate with existing infrastructure?
- Why is the framework flexible enough for experimentation?
- How does the framework’s community support and documentation benefit long-term maintenance?

**Step 5: Document your work**  
Create a document or slide deck detailing your framework selection and justification. Ensure your reasoning is clear and well supported by the project requirements and your understanding of the frameworks.

## Conclusion
This activity challenges you to apply your theoretical knowledge in a practical context, simulating the kind of decision-making required in real-world ML projects. By carefully considering the project requirements and aligning them with the strengths of a specific framework, you will develop a deeper understanding of how to select the right tool for the job.
