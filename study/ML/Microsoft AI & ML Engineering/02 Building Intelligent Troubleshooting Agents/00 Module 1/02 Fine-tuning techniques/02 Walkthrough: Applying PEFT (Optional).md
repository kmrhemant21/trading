# Walkthrough: Applying PEFT (Optional)

## Introduction
In this walkthrough, we will explore how to apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to a pretrained model, building on the activity you completed. You'll revisit key concepts and fine-tuning techniques, focusing on optimizing performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This guide will take you through the process step-by-step, from dataset preparation to model evaluation.

By the end of this walkthrough, you will be able to:

- Prepare a dataset for fine-tuning a pretrained language model.
- Fine-tune a pretrained model using task-specific training configurations.
- Evaluate the fine-tuned model using accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
- Optimize the fine-tuning process by adjusting hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Step-by-step process for applying PEFT to a pretrained model
This reading will guide you through the following steps:

1. Step 1: Prepare your dataset
2. Step 2: Fine-tune the pretrained model
3. Step 3: Evaluate the model
4. Step 4: Optimize the fine-tuning process (optional)

### Step 1: Prepare your dataset
The first step in fine-tuning a model is ensuring your dataset is appropriately prepared. In this walkthrough, we'll follow the same steps from the activity to clean, tokenize, and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This helps avoid overfitting and ensures proper model evaluation.

#### Instructions
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to avoid overfitting and ensure good generalization.
- Preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and padding the text.

#### Code example
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%)
train_data, temp_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
val_data, test_data = train_test_split(temp_data, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {len(train_data)}")
print(f"Validation set size: {len(val_data)}")
print(f"Test set size: {len(test_data)}")
```

#### Explanation
Here, we use train_test_split to divide the dataset into three parts: 70 percent for training, 15 percent for validation, and 15 percent for testing. This is accomplished by re-splitting the temp_data output from the first call of train_test_split. The training set is used to fine-tune the model, the validation set helps to monitor training progress, and the test set evaluates the final model performance.

### Step 2: Fine-tune the pretrained model
Once the data is prepared, the next step is to fine-tune the pretrained model (e.g., BERT) using the training data. Fine-tuning involves adapting the model's existing knowledge to a new, task-specific dataset.

#### Instructions
- Load a pretrained model (e.g., BERT).
- Set up the training arguments, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
- Begin fine-tuning the model on the training set.

#### Code example
```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pretrained BERT model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

# Fine-tune the model using the Trainer API
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_data,
    eval_dataset=val_data,
)

# Start fine-tuning the model
trainer.train()
```

#### Explanation
We use BERT for sequence classification, with three output labels in this example. The training arguments are defined using the TrainingArguments class, where you can specify the batch size, number of epochs, and evaluation strategy. Trainer is used to handle the fine-tuning process by taking care of the training loop, backpropagation, and model updates.

### Step 3: Evaluate the model
After fine-tuning the model, it's time to evaluate its performance on the test set. This allows you to measure how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

#### Instructions
- Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the test set using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
- Analyze the results to determine how well the model performs.

#### Code example
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score

# Evaluate the model on the test set
predictions_output = trainer.predict(test_data)
predictions = predictions_output.predictions.argmax(axis=-1) # Assuming a classification task

# Compute evaluation metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_data['label'], predictions)
f1 = f1_score(test_data['label'], predictions, average='weighted')
precision = precision_score(test_data['label'], predictions, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(test_data['label'], predictions, average='weighted')

print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Test F1 Score: {f1}")
print(f"Test Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Test Recall: {recall}")
```

#### Explanation
The model's performance is evaluated using four metrics: accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Accuracy gives a general overview of how well the model predicts, while F1 score, precision, and recall provide a deeper analysis of the model's effectiveness, especially for unbalanced datasets.

### Step 4: Optimize the fine-tuning process (optional)
You can experiment with different training configurations and hyperparameters to further improve the model's performance. This includes adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. You may also use hyperparameter search techniques to find the best configuration.

#### Optional instructions
- Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size.
- Use a hyperparameter search to find the best settings for your task.

#### Code example
```python
# Use hyperparameter search to optimize fine-tuning
best_model = trainer.hyperparameter_search(
    direction="maximize",
    n_trials=10
)
```

#### Explanation
Hyperparameter tuning allows you to experiment with different configurations, automatically finding the best setup for fine-tuning based on performance metrics.

## Conclusion
In this walkthrough, we explored the full solution to the fine-tuning activity. By following the steps outlined—preparing the dataset, fine-tuning a pretrained model, and evaluating its performance—you can successfully apply fine-tuning techniques to solve real-world tasks. Fine-tuning allows you to leverage the power of pretrained models while adapting them to your specific needs.
