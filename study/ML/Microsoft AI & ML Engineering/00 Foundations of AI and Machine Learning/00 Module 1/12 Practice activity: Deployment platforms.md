# Practice activity: Deployment platforms

## Introduction

Imagine a manufacturing plant where machines never fail unexpectedly and costly downtimes are a thing of the past. In this hands-on activity, you will apply the knowledge and skills you've gained throughout the course to address a real-world business problem. The goal is to integrate the concepts of data pipelines, model development, and deployment platforms to propose a solution. This exercise will help you think critically about how to approach AI/ML challenges in a practical context.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Design a robust data pipeline for real-time data processing.
- Choose an appropriate ML framework to build predictive models.
- Select the best deployment platform for scalable, real-time AI/ML solutions.

## Scenario

### Real-world business problem: Predictive maintenance for a manufacturing plant

You are working as a data scientist for a manufacturing company that operates several plants around the country. The company has been facing significant downtime due to unexpected equipment failures, leading to costly repairs and production delays. The management team has asked you to develop a predictive maintenance system that can monitor equipment data in real-time, predict potential failures before they occur, and schedule maintenance proactively to minimize downtime.

### Key considerations

- The system needs to collect and process large amounts of sensor data from various machines across multiple plants.
- The predictive model should be able to handle real-time data streams and provide accurate failure predictions.
- The solution should be scalable, as the company plans to expand the system to new plants in the future.
- The deployed model should be reliable, with minimal downtime, and secure to protect sensitive operational data.

## Activity instructions

Reflect on the business problem and key considerations provided. Write a short paragraph (four to five sentences) discussing how you might solve this issue using the concepts and tools discussed throughout the course. Be sure to address the three main aspects: data pipeline design, model development framework selection, and deployment platform choice.

Consider the following:

- How would you design the data pipeline to collect and process the sensor data?
- Which model development framework would you choose to build the predictive maintenance model, and why?
- What deployment platform would be best suited for this solution, considering the need for real-time data processing and scalability?

## Conclusion

This activity challenges you to design a solution that integrates data engineering, machine learning, and deployment practices for a practical AI/ML scenario. By addressing real-time data processing, scalability, and secure deployment, you will strengthen your problem-solving skills for handling complex business needs in AI/ML engineering.
