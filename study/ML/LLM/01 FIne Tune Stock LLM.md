Fine-tuning an LLM to power your own stock-market bot is a fantastic way to get tailored, domain-aware responses—whether for chart commentary, trade ideas, or FAQ about your strategy. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you there:

---

## 1. Define the Bot’s Capabilities

First, be crystal clear on what you want your bot to do. For example:

* **Market commentary** (“What’s happening with AAPL this week?”)
* **Technical analysis** (“Give me the RSI and MACD signals on MSFT.”)
* **Trade execution prompts** (“If RSI <30 on a weekly chart, suggest a long setup.”)
* **Portfolio reporting** (“Summarize my holdings performance.”)

Your fine-tuning data and prompt design will flow directly from these goals.

---

## 2. Gather & Prepare Training Data

### a. Collect Examples

You’ll need **input→desired output** pairs. Some sources:

* **Historical chat logs** with analysts or yourself
* **Prompt→response** pairs you’d like the bot to produce (e.g. “Analyze TSLA’s weekly chart.” → a structured technical-analysis write-up)
* **API call templates** (e.g. JSON bodies for your trading engine)

### b. Format as JSONL

Each line should be a JSON object with fields like:

```json
{"prompt":"Analyze the 14-week RSI on AAPL and suggest action.","completion":"The 14-week RSI for AAPL is 72.8 (overbought). Consider a partial profit-taking if long; watch for RSI crossing below 70 on next close."}
```

### c. Split into Train/Validation

Reserve \~10–20% of your examples for validation so you can monitor overfitting.

## 3. Choose Your Fine-Tuning Method

* **Full fine-tuning** (all weights) if you have GPU resources ≥16 GB and a lot of examples.
* **Parameter-efficient methods** (LoRA, Adapters) if your dataset is small or you want fast iterations.

I recommend **LoRA** via Hugging Face’s [`peft`](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) for most stock-bot use cases.

## 4. Set Up the Training Pipeline

Below is a minimal example using Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT + LoRA. Assume you’ve prepared `stock_bot_data.jsonl`.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from peft import get_peft_config, get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType
import datasets

# 1. Choose base model
model_name = "gpt2-medium"  # or an Llama-style open model
tokenizer  = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model      = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# 2. Load & tokenize your data
ds = datasets.load_dataset("json", data_files="stock_bot_data.jsonl")
def tokenize(ex):
    tok = tokenizer(ex["prompt"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=256)
    labels = tokenizer(ex["completion"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=256)
    tok["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
    return tok
ds = ds["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.1)
tokenized = ds.map(tokenize, batched=True)

# 3. Configure LoRA
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    inference_mode=False,
    r=16,           # rank
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1
)
model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

# 4. Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="ft-stock-bot",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=3e-5,
    logging_steps=50,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=200,
    save_total_limit=2
)

# 5. Trainer & train
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized["train"],
    eval_dataset= tokenized["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)
trainer.train()

# 6. Save your fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("ft-stock-bot")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("ft-stock-bot")
```

---

## 5. Validate & Iterate

* **Quantitative checks**: Run your bot on held-out prompts and measure loss.
* **Qualitative checks**: Feed in fresh analyst questions; see if the tone and accuracy meet your expectations.
* **Adjust**: If it hallucinates numbers, add more “ground-truth” examples. If it’s too verbose, include shorter-example completions.

---

## 6. Production Deployment

* **Wrap** your model in an API (FastAPI/Flask) with a simple `/generate` endpoint.
* **Add retrieval**: augment each prompt with the latest price/indicator data fetched at runtime so the model always “sees” up-to-date numbers.
* **Monitor** logs for errors, prompt-response drift, and retrain periodically with new examples.

---

### Next Steps for You

1. **Gather \~500–2 000 prompt/response pairs** covering your core bot use-cases.
2. **Decide** whether full fine-tuning or LoRA fits your compute/data constraints.
3. **Run** the example pipeline above, beginning with a small epoch/tiny batch to sanity-check.
4. **Evaluate** and expand your dataset as you uncover gaps (e.g. more examples of “exit signals,” “position sizing advice,” etc.).

With these steps you’ll have a specialized LLM that “speaks financials,” understands your indicators, and can drive your trading automation with reliable, domain-tailored dialogue. Let me know how your data looks or if you want to dig into any of these steps in more detail!
