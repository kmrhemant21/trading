# 📌 **THE 4 OI–PRICE QUADRANTS (Most Important Concept in Derivatives)**

These 4 regimes tell you exactly what **smart money is doing**.

We use:

* **Price Movement**
* **Open Interest Movement (OI)**

OI ↑ = new positions added
OI ↓ = positions closed/unwound

---

# 1️⃣ **Long Build-Up**

### ✔️ Price ↑

### ✔️ OI ↑

### → Buyers are entering aggressively (fresh longs)

### Meaning:

* New long positions are being created.
* Traders expect **further upside**.
* Strong bullish confirmation.

### Example:

* Yesterday NIFTY Future = 21,800 (OI = 1,20,000)
* Today NIFTY Future = 22,050 (OI = 1,45,000)

Price went **up**, OI went **up** → **Long Build-up**

📌 **Interpretation:**
Big players are buying, expecting further rise.

---

# 2️⃣ **Short Build-Up**

### ✔️ Price ↓

### ✔️ OI ↑

### → New shorts created (fresh selling pressure)

### Meaning:

* Traders are shorting aggressively.
* Expectation: **price will fall more**.
* Very bearish confirmation.

### Example:

* Yesterday: 21,800 (OI = 1,20,000)
* Today: 21,450 (OI = 1,50,000)

Price ↓, OI ↑ → **Short Build-Up**

📌 **Interpretation:**
Fresh selling entering → Downtrend is strengthening.

---

# 3️⃣ **Short Covering**

### ✔️ Price ↑

### ✔️ OI ↓

### → Shorts are exiting (closing positions)

### Meaning:

* Traders who were short are closing (buying back).
* Buying pressure exists, but **not fresh bullish positions**, only closing shorts.
* Often indicates a **bounce** or **end of downtrend**.

### Example:

* Yesterday: 21,800 (OI = 1,50,000)
* Today: 22,000 (OI = 1,20,000)

Price ↑, OI ↓ → **Short Covering**

📌 **Interpretation:**
Shorts are scared → Pause/reversal from lower levels.

---

# 4️⃣ **Long Unwinding**

### ✔️ Price ↓

### ✔️ OI ↓

### → Longs are exiting their positions

### Meaning:

* Profit booking / exit by long holders.
* Not aggressive short selling — just longs leaving.
* Weakness, but not strong bearishness.

### Example:

* Yesterday: 21,800 (OI = 1,50,000)
* Today: 21,600 (OI = 1,20,000)

Price ↓, OI ↓ → **Long Unwinding**

📌 **Interpretation:**
Long buyers are closing → weak market → could fall more if shorts join.

# 🎯 SUMMARY TABLE (Keep this in mind)

| Price  | OI     | Name               | What it means                |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ↑ Up   | ↑ Up   | **Long Build-Up**  | Strong bullish trend         |
| ↓ Down | ↑ Up   | **Short Build-Up** | Strong bearish trend         |
| ↑ Up   | ↓ Down | **Short Covering** | Bullish reversal from bottom |
| ↓ Down | ↓ Down | **Long Unwinding** | Weakness, mild bearish       |

---

# 🔥 VERY SIMPLE VISUAL MEMORY

```
PRICE ↑  +  OI ↑  = Long Build-Up (Fresh buying)
PRICE ↓  +  OI ↑  = Short Build-Up (Fresh selling)

PRICE ↑  +  OI ↓  = Short Covering (Shorts exiting)
PRICE ↓  +  OI ↓  = Long Unwinding (Longs exiting)
```

# 🧠 Real Market Example (e.g., Reliance)

| Day   | Price | OI       | Regime         | Meaning                 |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Day 1 | 2400  | 5,00,000 | -              | -                       |
| Day 2 | 2450  | 5,60,000 | Long Build-up  | Fresh buying → Bullish  |
| Day 3 | 2420  | 5,90,000 | Short Build-up | Fresh selling → Bearish |
| Day 4 | 2455  | 5,40,000 | Short Covering | Shorts exit → Bullish   |
| Day 5 | 2430  | 5,00,000 | Long Unwinding | Longs exit → Weakness   |

You see how price + OI tells the **true story** of what traders are doing?

# Want me to add these explanations into your script output also?

Like:

> “Quadrant: Long Build-up → Fresh long positions being added. Bullish continuation likely.”

I can integrate this as **plain English reasoning** too.
