# Walkthrough: Deploying and repairing AI/ML systems (Optional)

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, you will analyze a case study and think through AI/ML system deployment and repair strategies for a predictive maintenance system in an autonomous delivery drone fleet. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the deploying and repairing AI/ML systems activity, focusing on identifying the key issues, proposing AI/ML solutions, deploying the system, and maintaining it over time.

By the end of this walkthrough, you will be able to:

- Analyze and develop an AI/ML-based predictive maintenance system for autonomous delivery drones, addressing key challenges, implementing effective deployment strategies, and planning for ongoing system maintenance and scalability.

## Step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Problem identification

The first step is to identify the key challenges and available data for implementing a predictive maintenance system for autonomous drones. Understanding the problems and data sources is crucial for designing a solution that can minimize unplanned downtime and improve operational efficiency by leveraging real-time insights and historical trends.

#### Key problems

- **Unpredictable drone failures**: the current system uses fixed maintenance schedules, which don't account for real-time data or the actual condition of the drones.
- **Costly downtime**: unexpected failures are leading to downtime, which is negatively impacting business operations and delivery schedules.

#### Data available

- **Sensor data from drones**: information such as battery levels, motor speeds, temperature, GPS data, flight hours, and mechanical statuses.
- **Historical failure and maintenance data**: logs of previous failures, including sensor readings leading up to the failures.

#### System requirements

- **Real-time monitoring**: the system should monitor drone health in real time to detect early signs of failure.
- **Predictive capability**: it should predict potential failures before they happen to minimize downtime.
- **Integration**: the system must integrate with the existing drone fleet management platform to trigger alerts and schedule maintenance efficiently.

### Step 2: AI/ML solution

The next step focuses on selecting appropriate models and preparing the data for accurate predictions. The goal is to leverage historical data and real-time sensor readings to detect anomalies and predict failures, ensuring the drones operate efficiently with minimal interruptions.

#### Model selection

- **Time-series analysis for sensor data**: since the data is continuous and time-dependent, time-series models (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks) are well-suited for predicting failures based on sensor readings over time.
- **Anomaly detection**: use models like Isolation Forests or autoencoders to detect unusual behavior in drones, such as abnormal battery usage or temperature spikes, which could signal impending failures.
- **Regression models**: predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of key components, such as the battery or motors, by analyzing past usage and sensor data.

#### Data preprocessing

- **Cleaning data**: remove or impute missing sensor readings, handle outliers, and normalize the sensor values for optimal model performance.
- **Feature engineering**: create new features from the sensor data, such as the rate of battery discharge or temperature changes over time, to help the model better detect anomalies or predict failures.

#### Model training

- **Training dataset**: use historical sensor data leading up to known drone failures to train the model. Include both normal operation data and failure data.
- **Evaluation metrics**:
    - For anomaly detection: Precision, Recall, F1-score.
    - For predictive models: Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared for regression tasks.

#### Example

If using an LSTM model, the input will consist of sequences of sensor readings, and the output will predict the likelihood of failure or estimate the remaining useful life of components.

### Step 3: Deployment strategy

Deploying the AI/ML solution comes next. In a real-world environment, you must balance the need for real-time, edge-based decision-making with cloud-based processing for complex tasks. Ensuring smooth integration with the existing fleet management system and maintaining continuous model updates are key to optimizing drone operations and minimizing downtime.

#### Deployment environment

- **Edge computing**: given that drones operate autonomously and often need real-time decision-making, edge computing is an optimal choice. The AI/ML model can be deployed on onboard devices to process sensor data locally, allowing the drones to trigger real-time alerts without relying on cloud infrastructure.
- **Cloud-based model**: for more complex model training and updates, the system could be deployed in the cloud, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure, to process larger amounts of data and send predictions back to the drones for real-time decision-making.

#### System integration

- **Integration with the drone management system**: the AI/ML system should seamlessly integrate with the existing fleet management software. This integration ensures that alerts can be sent to operators and maintenance requests can be automatically scheduled when a potential failure is detected.
- **Alerting and monitoring**: real-time alerts should be triggered if the model detects abnormal sensor readings. A centralized dashboard should provide operators with insights into drone health and predictive maintenance schedules.

#### Monitoring and maintenance

- **Continuous monitoring**: after deployment, monitor the system's performance and validate predictions in real time. Implement dashboards that show drone health status and any predicted failures.
- **Periodic model retraining**: set up a pipeline to automatically retrain the model when new sensor data becomes available, ensuring that the model adapts to changes in drone usage or operating conditions.

### Step 4: Addressing system failures and maintenance

Finally, maintain and optimize the AI/ML system after deployment. Ensure that it adapts to changing conditions and scales with the growing drone fleet. Effective error handling, addressing model drift, and ensuring scalability are essential to keep the system running smoothly and prevent operational disruptions.

#### Error handling

- **False positives/negatives**: if the system flags too many false positives (unnecessary maintenance) or misses actual failures (false negatives), adjust the model's threshold for flagging anomalies or retrain the model with more balanced data.
- **Model calibration**: fine-tune the model to strike a balance between detecting all potential failures while minimizing unnecessary alerts.

#### Model drift

- **Handling model drift**: as the fleet ages or new drones are introduced, the model's accuracy may degrade. Implement automated retraining at regular intervals or when new data becomes available. Monitor model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to detect when drift occurs and act accordingly.

#### System scalability

- **Scalability considerations**: as the company expands its fleet or incorporates new drone models, the AI/ML system must be scalable. Cloud-based infrastructure can handle increased data volumes, and edge devices must be capable of handling the expanded scope of operations.
- **Load balancing**: ensure that both edge and cloud systems can handle multiple drones simultaneously, distributing computational resources as needed.

## Final deliverables

### Solution report summary:

- **Key problems**: unpredictable drone failures and costly downtime.
- **Proposed solution**: time-series models for failure prediction, anomaly detection for early warning, and real-time monitoring using edge computing.
- **Deployment plan**: deploy AI/ML models on edge devices for real-time failure prediction, integrate with the fleet management system, and monitor the system using dashboards.
- **Repair plan**: retrain models periodically to avoid model drift, calibrate the system to reduce false positives, and scale the solution as the fleet grows.

### Optional code implementation:
If you implemented a prototype solution using sample drone data, it could include:

- Preprocessing sensor data (cleaning, normalizing, feature engineering).
- Training a time-series model (e.g., LSTM) to predict failure events.
- Deploying the model on a simulated edge environment for real-time analysis.

## Conclusion

By considering potential system failures and model drift, you prepared a comprehensive solution that ensures ongoing reliability and scalability.
