# Practice activity: Selecting and justifying a framework

## Introduction

In this activity, you will be given a common real-world problem and asked to select an appropriate ML framework to solve it. The goal is to justify your selection based on the problem’s requirements, the strengths of the framework, and how it aligns with your intended solution. The activity should take approximately 60–90 minutes to complete.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Analyze the requirements of a recommendation system and identify the most suitable ML model.
- Evaluate various ML frameworks and select the one that aligns with the project’s technical and business needs.
- Provide a well-reasoned justification for your choice of ML framework, taking into account factors such as scalability, ease of use, and the ability to handle large datasets.

## Problem scenario

Imagine you are working for a retail company that wants to improve its customer experience by implementing a recommendation system. The goal is to recommend products to customers based on their previous purchases, browsing behavior, and demographic information. The company has a large dataset that includes customer transaction histories, product information, and user ratings.

## Your task

### Analyze the problem

Begin by considering the key requirements of the recommendation system. What kind of data will you be working with? What is the desired outcome (e.g., personalized product recommendations)?

Think about the type of model that would be best suited for this task (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid models).

### Select a framework

Based on your analysis, choose an ML framework that you believe is best suited to develop this recommendation system.

Consider factors such as the framework’s capabilities, ease of use, scalability, and community support.

### Justify your selection

Write a brief justification (approximately one to two paragraphs) explaining why you chose this particular framework.

Include specific reasons, such as the framework’s strengths in handling large datasets, its support for specific types of models (e.g., neural networks, matrix factorization), and any relevant tools or libraries that make it an ideal choice for this problem.

## Guiding questions

- Does the framework support the type of model you want to use (e.g., TensorFlow for deep learning, Scikit-learn for simpler models)?
- How well does the framework handle large datasets?
- Is the framework scalable to meet future demands as the recommendation system grows?
- What is the level of community and documentation support available for the framework?
- Are there any specific libraries or tools associated with the framework that would be particularly useful for a recommendation system?

## Deliverable

Summarize the following items as a short written document or slide deck. Be clear and concise, and address all aspects of the problem scenario.

- **Framework selection:** Clearly state the framework you selected (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
- **Justification:** Provide a well-reasoned justification for your choice, addressing the questions above and any other relevant considerations.

## Conclusion

This activity is designed to help you practice making strategic decisions in AI/ML projects by aligning the technical capabilities of frameworks with real-world business needs. Selecting the right framework is a critical skill that ensures your solutions are not only effective but also scalable and maintainable. After completing this activity, you will have a deeper understanding of how to evaluate and choose the best tools for different ML tasks.
