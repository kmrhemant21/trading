## Summary and Highlights

In this lesson, you have learned:

### Data Transformation and Exploration
- Raw data requires transformation and cleansing tasks to become analytics-ready
- Understanding your dataset from multiple perspectives is essential
- Querying is a key method for dataset exploration

### Basic Querying Techniques
- **Counting and aggregating** datasets
- **Identifying extreme values**
- **Slicing data** into manageable portions
- **Sorting data** for better organization
- **Filtering patterns** to find specific information
- **Grouping data** for analysis

### Performance Monitoring in Data Engineering
- Continuous monitoring is required for:
    - Data pipelines
    - Platforms and databases
    - Applications and tools
    - Queries and scheduled jobs

### Common Performance Issues
- **Workload increases** can impact pipeline performance
- **Application failures** disrupt data flow
- **Scheduled job failures** affect data processing
- **Tool compatibility issues** cause pipeline problems
- **Database outages** and capacity issues
- **Application slowdowns** and conflicting queries

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Real-time monitoring systems** collect quantitative data
- **Alerting systems** provide visibility into performance metrics
- **Time-based and condition-based maintenance** schedules help identify:
    - Systems responsible for faults
    - Procedures causing low availability
