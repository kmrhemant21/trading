# Practice activity: Justifying a platform choice in a presentation to a C-suite executive

## Introduction
In this hands-on activity, you will research and justify your choice of a deployment platform for an ML model. In the real world, your team and your company will look to you to back up your convictions with actionable data. Choosing the wrong platform could mean you can’t scale your model’s deployment. For this reason, it’s important to adopt a solid evaluation process that can adapt over time to new products, environments, and tools. 

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Practice evaluating various platforms based on key criteria.
- Present your findings in a concise report. 

## Activity instructions

### Step 1: Research deployment platforms
Select three platforms: choose three deployment platforms to compare. These may include cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, Google AI Platform, or on-premises solutions. Here are some possible sources to consult:

- Official platform websites and documentation.
- Industry reports from sources such as Gartner, Forrester, or IDC.
- Case studies and user reviews on platforms such as G2 or TrustRadius.
- Technical blogs and white papers from experts in the field.

Evaluate key features: research each platform focusing on the following criteria, plus any additional criteria that are important to your specific use case, such as security features, compliance with regulations, or community support:

- **Scalability**: how well does the platform support scaling to meet future demands?
- **Cost**: what are the short-term and long-term costs associated with the platform?
- **Ease of use**: how user-friendly is the platform for both developers and end-users?
- **Integration**: how well does the platform integrate with your existing tools and tech stack?
- **Support for ML models**: does the platform provide robust support for deploying and managing ML models?

Create a comparison table: complete a table like the one seen below to compare the three platforms across the criteria listed above, plus any additional criteria you’d like to investigate. 

| Criteria                  | Platform 1 | Platform 2 | Platform 3 |
|---------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Scalability               |            |            |            |
| Cost                      |            |            |            |
| Ease of use               |            |            |            |
| Integration with existing tools |      |            |            |
| Support for ML models     |            |            |            |
| Performance               |            |            |            |
| [Your additional criterion] |         |            |            |

### Step 2: Analyze and choose a platform
Review your comparison table and evaluate the pros and cons of each platform.

- Which platform best aligns with your project’s goals and technical requirements?
- What are the key trade-offs between cost, scalability, and ease of use?
- Are there any critical limitations of the platforms that could impact your decision?
- How does each platform address both your immediate needs and potential future requirements?

### Step 3: Justify your platform choice
Write a justification report following the example structure below.

- **Introduction**: briefly describe the three platforms you evaluated.
- **Evaluation summary**: summarize the key findings from your comparison table, highlighting the most important criteria.
- **Justification**: clearly state your chosen platform and justify your decision. Explain why this platform is the best fit based on your analysis.
- **Supporting evidence**: include case studies, benchmarks, or expert opinions to back up your choice. Discuss how this evidence reinforces your decision and addresses potential risks or trade-offs.
- **Future considerations**: discuss how the chosen platform will support long-term goals, such as scalability, integration, or cost efficiency.

## Conclusion
This activity challenges you to think strategically about technology choices and articulate their business value to top executives. By completing this exercise, you will gain experience in aligning technical decisions with business goals, a critical skill for any technology leader.
