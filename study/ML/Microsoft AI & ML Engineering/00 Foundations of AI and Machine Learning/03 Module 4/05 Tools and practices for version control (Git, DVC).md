# Tools and Practices for Version Control (Git, DVC)

## Introduction

Version control is a cornerstone of modern software development and is particularly important in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) projects where managing code, models, and data is crucial. 

By the end of this reading, you will be able to:

- Explain the best practices for using two key tools that provide robust version control capabilities for different aspects of your AI/ML projects. These tools are Git and data version control (DVC).

## 1. Git: The Foundation of Version Control

### Overview

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project. It’s widely used across the software industry and is essential for managing the code in AI/ML projects.

### Key Features

- **Branching and merging**: Git creates branches to independently work on different features or experiments and merge them back into the main project once they’re ready.
- **Commit history**: Git keeps a detailed log of every change made to your code, making it easy to track progress and revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Collaboration**: Git uses platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to collaborate with team members, review code, and manage pull requests.

### Best Practices

- **Use branches effectively**: Create a new branch for each feature or experiment. This keeps your main branch clean and stable.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-new-algorithm
    ```

- **Write clear commit messages**: Every commit should have a clear and descriptive message that explains which changes were made and why.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added data preprocessing step to handle missing values"
    ```

- **Regularly push to remote repositories**: Keep your remote repository up to date by regularly pushing your local changes. This also serves as a backup.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature-new-algorithm
    ```

- **Review and merge with pull requests**: When a feature or experiment is ready, create a pull request to merge it into the main branch. This is a good opportunity to conduct code reviews and ensure that all changes are properly documented.

### Tools for Git Integration

- **GitHub**: The most popular platform for hosting Git repositories, with additional tools such as issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **GitLab**: Similar to GitHub but with integrated CI/CD and DevOps tools.
- **Bitbucket**: Another Git platform that integrates well with Jira for project management.

## 2. DVC: Version Control for Data and Models

### Overview

While Git is excellent for versioning code, it’s not ideal for handling large files like datasets and machine learning models. This is where DVC comes in. DVC is an open-source tool that extends Git’s functionality to manage and version control large data files, models, and ML pipelines.

### Key Features

- **Data versioning**: DVC allows you to version control large datasets and models without clogging up your Git repository. It tracks the metadata of files while storing the actual data in a remote storage location (e.g., S3, Google Drive).
- **Pipeline management**: DVC can also manage the stages of an ML pipeline, ensuring that each step’s inputs, outputs, and dependencies are tracked and reproducible.
- **Remote storage integration**: DVC integrates with various remote storage services, allowing you to push your data and models to cloud storage and track them in your Git repository.

### Best Practices

- **Initialize DVC in your repository**: Start by initializing DVC in your Git repository. This sets up the necessary configuration files.

    ```bash
    dvc init
    git commit -m "Initialized DVC"
    ```

- **Track large files with DVC**: Use DVC to track datasets, models, and other large files. This prevents your Git repository from becoming bloated with large files.

    ```bash
    dvc add data/raw-data.csv
    git add data/raw-data.csv.dvc .gitignore
    git commit -m "Tracked raw data with DVC"
    ```

- **Manage pipelines**: Define your ML pipeline with DVC to ensure that every step, from data preprocessing to model training, is reproducible.

    Example `dvc.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    stages:
        preprocess:
            cmd: python src/preprocess.py
            deps:
            - src/preprocess.py
            - data/raw-data.csv
            outs:
            - data/processed-data.csv
        train:
            cmd: python src/train.py
            deps:
            - src/train.py
            - data/processed-data.csv
            outs:
            - models/model.pkl
    ```

- **Use remote storage for data**: Configure DVC to use remote storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive) for storing large datasets and models.

    ```bash
    dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/path
    dvc push
    ```

- **Collaborate on data and models**: Just like with Git, collaborate on data and models using DVC. Ensure that team members pull the latest versions of datasets and models.

    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```

### Tools for DVC Integration

- **DVC command-line tool**: This tool is the primary interface for working with DVC, available on all major platforms.
- **VS Code DVC extension**: This tool integrates DVC into Visual Studio Code, providing a visual interface for managing datasets and pipelines.
- **Continuous Machine Learning (CML)**: A tool from the DVC team that integrates with CI/CD platforms to automate machine learning workflows.

## 3. Combining Git and DVC for Effective Version Control

Git and DVC complement each other in managing different aspects of AI/ML projects. Here’s how you can effectively combine them:

- **Version control for code (Git)**: Use Git to track all your code, including scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation. Git will handle the branching, merging, and collaboration aspects.
- **Version control for data and models (DVC)**: Use DVC to track large datasets and models. While Git tracks the changes to code and metadata, DVC manages the actual data and model files, storing them in remote storage.
- **Reproducible pipelines**: Combine Git and DVC to create fully reproducible pipelines. Use Git to version control your pipeline scripts and DVC to ensure that the data and models used at each stage are correctly tracked and versioned.

### Collaboration Workflow

1. Start a new branch in Git for your feature or experiment.
2. Track your datasets and models with DVC.
3. Push your code changes to Git and your data/model changes to DVC remote storage.
4. Create a pull request when your work is ready to be reviewed and merged.

## Conclusion

Version control is critical in AI/ML projects, where managing code, data, and models is essential for reproducibility, collaboration, and successful deployments. Combining Git with DVC ensures that every aspect of your project is versioned, tracked, and easily managed, no matter how complex the project becomes. 

Adopting these tools and best practices will improve the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of your AI/ML workflows.
