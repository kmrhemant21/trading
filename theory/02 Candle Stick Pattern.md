# 🕯️ What is a Candlestick Pattern?

A **candlestick** is a way of representing price action in trading (stocks, forex, crypto, commodities, etc.) over a specific time frame (1 min, 5 min, 1 day, 1 week, etc.).

Each candlestick shows **four key data points**:

* **Open price** (where price started in that period)
* **Close price** (where price ended)
* **High price** (the maximum in that period)
* **Low price** (the minimum in that period)

The **body** = difference between open and close.
The **wicks (shadows)** = high/low outside the body.

* If **close > open** → candle is usually green/white (bullish).
* If **close < open** → candle is red/black (bearish).

### Candlestick Patterns

When multiple candles form certain **shapes or sequences**, they can signal possible **market psychology** (fear/greed) and **future price movement**.
Examples:

* **Bullish Engulfing** → possible uptrend start
* **Bearish Engulfing** → possible downtrend start
* **Doji** (small/no body) → market indecision
* **Hammer / Inverted Hammer** → reversal signs

## 📈 For What Kind of Trading is it Useful?

Candlestick patterns are mostly used in **technical analysis**.

* **Intraday / Scalping (minutes–hours):**

  * Traders use candlesticks on 1-min, 5-min, 15-min charts.
  * Helps spot quick reversals, breakouts, or continuation patterns.

* **Swing Trading (days–weeks):**

  * Candlestick setups on daily or 4-hour charts are useful to spot entry/exit levels.

* **Position Trading / Long-term investing (months–years):**

  * Candlesticks are less important alone but can support trend confirmation along with fundamentals.

✅ **Best use:**
Candlestick patterns work best when combined with **support/resistance, volume, moving averages, RSI/MACD** etc. They are **not foolproof**—use them as part of a bigger strategy.
