Given the high costs associated with processing each song using large language models (LLMs) for content evaluation, an alternative method using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is proposed. RAG combines the benefits of a retriever model, which fetches relevant information (in this case, embeddings of pre-answered content appropriateness questions), and a generator model, which uses this information to predict the appropriateness of new content. This approach efficiently scales the evaluation process while ensuring that each song's content is scrutinized for child safety without the overhead of running a full LLM for each song.\n","\n","![A big yellow bird puppet and a purple dinosaur puppet singing next to a rapper and a metal band singer](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/MGy9JGkmyNnnTPqNlXk2uw/The%20scene%20is%20lively%20and%20colorful.jpg)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b19c082c-91cd-41df-99c1-01ffcb59d0dd","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Defining-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Embeddings-using-BERT-and-PyTorch-Hub\">Embeddings using BERT and PyTorch Hub</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Loading-tokenizer-and-model\">Loading tokenizer and model</a>\n","                <ol>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Tokenization\">Tokenization</a></li>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Text-decoding-and-verification\">Text decoding and verification</a></li>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Device-and-Convert-Tensor\">Device and Convert Tensor</a></li>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Loading-the-BERT-model\">Loading the BERT model</a></li>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Generating-aggregated-mean-embeddings-using-BERT-for-RAG\">Generating aggregated mean embeddings using BERT for RAG</a></li>\n","                </ol>\n","            </li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Convert-questions-and-the-song-lyrics-into-embeddings\">Convert questions and the song lyrics into embeddings</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Understanding-the-dot-product\">Understanding the dot product</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Exercise\">Exercise</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Task-description\">Task description</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2dc7bd9c-6ebc-4e0c-bcac-4871fb3f2d1d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e8798cff-62fa-42f8-af7a-15c4a1d9d9d1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n","\n","- **Understand embedding techniques**: Learn how to generate and use embeddings from pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.\n","- **Use Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch**: Apply the transformers library to load and work with advanced NLP models like BERT in PyTorch..\n","- **Apply t-SNE for visualization**: Use t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces, enhancing understanding of data distribution and clustering.\n","- **Fine-tuning language models**: Gain practical experience in fine-tuning pretrained language models for specific tasks, enhancing model performance on targeted datasets.\n","- **Develop practical NLP solutions**: Implement a system that effectively uses Retriever and Generator architectures to answer queries, demonstrating an end-to-end workflow from model tuning to deployment.\n","- **Implement cosine similarity**: Replace dot product similarity measures with cosine similarity to improve relevance detection in response generation systems.\n","- **Evaluate model performance**: Assess the impact of using cosine similarity over dot product in terms of retrieval accuracy and relevance in a QA system.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e6bbf84a-c1de-4238-a1a6-f02b15c12630","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7e82f3e3-3f7a-4c20-b3da-87928cfce005","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6b0a3a3a-2822-4dbb-adf1-fc824f745db5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"76d3addf-7191-4f01-a31c-df8836a16820","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Installing required libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4edfd5ee-d00e-4585-bec2-23d7bdbcf98f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, you will be using the following libraries.
