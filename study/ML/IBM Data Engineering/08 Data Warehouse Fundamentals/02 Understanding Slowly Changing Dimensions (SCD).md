# Understanding Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

**Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**: Methods used to monitor changes in dimension attributes, manage updates, and preserve historical data in data warehousing.

## Types of SCD

### Type 0: Static Dimensions
- **Description**: Retains original value without any updates
- **Use Case**: Static dimensions that do not change over time
- **Examples**: Product codes, account numbers
- **Advantages**: Simple to implement, effective for rarely changing dimensions
- **Disadvantages**: No flexibility for updates

### Type 1: Overwrite Existing Data
- **Description**: Updates the existing data directly, losing historical records
- **Use Case**: When only current state data is needed
- **Examples**: Correcting spelling mistakes, updating contact information
- **Advantages**: 
    - Easy to implement
    - Saves storage space
- **Disadvantages**: 
    - No historical data is retained
    - May lead to inaccurate historical reporting

### Type 2: Preserve Historical Data (Row Versioning)
- **Description**: Tracks changes by adding new rows for updates, preserving full historical data
- **Use Case**: When full history of changes is essential
- **Examples**: Tracking customer address changes for legal compliance/auditing
- **Implementation**: Uses start/end dates or flags to indicate current version
- **Advantages**: 
    - Full historical data preserved
    - Easy to query data as it existed at any point in time
- **Disadvantages**: 
    - Increases dimension table size
    - Requires careful management of versioning fields

### Type 3: Add New Attribute (Limited History)
- **Description**: Tracks limited history by adding new columns for different versions of an attribute
- **Use Case**: When only a small number of changes need tracking
- **Examples**: Storing current and previous customer address in separate columns
- **Advantages**: 
    - Easy to implement
    - Requires less space than Type 2
- **Disadvantages**: 
    - Can only track limited history
    - Does not maintain complete history of changes

### Type 4: Historical Table
- **Description**: Stores historical data in a separate table, maintaining current data in the main dimension table
- **Use Case**: When separation of current and historical data improves performance
- **Implementation**: Main table for current data, separate historical table for previous versions
- **Advantages**: 
    - Maintains complete historical record
    - Separates current and historical data
- **Disadvantages**: 
    - More complex to implement
    - Requires additional storage for historical tables

### Type 6: Hybrid Approach
- **Description**: Combines aspects of Types 1, 2, and 3 to track current and historical data flexibly
- **Use Case**: When flexible solution is needed for both current and historical tracking
- **Implementation**: Combines current flag (Type 1), new rows (Type 2), and previous versions (Type 3)
- **Advantages**: 
    - Combines benefits of other types
    - Tracks complete history while maintaining current state
- **Disadvantages**: 
    - More complex to manage
    - Requires more storage

## Key Considerations for Implementation

### 1. Business Requirements
- Assess whether historical changes need tracking
- Determine how much history needs to be retained

### 2. Versioning Management
- For Type 2: Implement start date, end date, and current flag
- Handle versioning fields carefully to avoid errors

### 3. Storage and Performance
- Consider performance impact on dimension table queries
- Balance historical tracking needs with storage constraints

### 4. ETL Process Design
- **Type 1**: ETL updates existing rows only
- **Type 2**: ETL must detect changes and insert new rows
- Design ETL process to fit chosen SCD type

## Conclusion

Slowly Changing Dimensions provide a robust framework for managing changes in dimension data over time. By selecting the appropriate SCD type based on business requirements, organizations can:

- Ensure accurate reporting
- Maintain historical data integrity
- Optimize data warehouse performance

Whether implementing simple overwriting (Type 1), full historical tracking (Type 2), or a hybrid solution (Type 6), the right SCD strategy is crucial for long-term data management success.
