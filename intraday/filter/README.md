Here’s a clean, professional **README.md** you can drop alongside your script — it documents the purpose, logic, setup, and scoring model of your **Intraday Stock Filter** pipeline.

# 📈 Intraday Stock Filter

### *VOLAR + F&O Sentiment + Delivery% + Candlestick Confirmation*

---

## 🔍 Overview

This tool filters and ranks stocks from your **universe (symbols.txt)** for **intraday trading** based on a multi-factor scoring model.

It combines **quantitative**, **derivative**, and **market microstructure** indicators to identify the strongest long or short candidates for the day.

---

## ⚙️ Core Idea

Instead of trading every symbol, the script selects **high-probability setups** by blending:

| Layer | Factor                             | Purpose                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | **VOLAR Ranking**                  | Detects stocks with strong risk-adjusted momentum       |
| 2️⃣   | **F&O Sentiment**                  | Confirms institutional bias (long/short build-up)       |
| 3️⃣   | **Delivery %**                     | Measures real investor participation vs. intraday churn |
| 4️⃣   | **Candlestick Pattern (optional)** | Confirms recent bullish or bearish price action         |

Each layer contributes to a **final composite score** → higher score = stronger trade candidate.

---

## 🧮 Scoring Model

```text
Final_Score =
    0.45 * VOLAR_norm
  + 0.35 * F&O_Score
  + 0.15 * Delivery_Score
  + 0.05 * Candle_Score
```

> Weights are configurable inside `CONFIG`.

| Component      | Range     | Meaning                                                 |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| VOLAR_norm     | −1 → +1   | Volatility-adjusted return (higher = steadier momentum) |
| F&O_Score      | −1 → +1   | From option chain sentiment and PCR bias                |
| Delivery_Score | −1 → +1   | Higher delivery% → more genuine participation           |
| Candle_Score   | −1, 0, +1 | Recent price action tilt (hammer, engulfing, etc.)      |

---

## 🧩 Bias Classification

After scoring, each stock is labeled:

| Label          | Condition                           | Interpretation            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Long Bias**  | Final Score ≥ 0.2 and net tilt > 0  | Consider for long setups  |
| **Short Bias** | Final Score ≤ −0.2 and net tilt < 0 | Consider for short setups |
| **Watchlist**  | Mixed or weak signals               | Keep under observation    |
| **Skip**       | Fails liquidity or price filters    | Not suitable for intraday |

---

## 🧱 Quality Filters

Before scoring, the script screens for tradeable stocks:

| Filter           | Default        | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `MIN_PRICE`      | ₹100           | Avoid illiquid/penny names                     |
| `MIN_VOLUMN_AVG` | `2e5` (2 lakh) | 20-day avg volume threshold                    |
| `TOP_N_PRINT`    | 20             | How many stocks to display in terminal summary |

Any stock failing these becomes **“Skip”** in the output.

## ⚡ Tips

* Adjust weights in `CONFIG` to emphasize your preferred factors.
  Example: more derivative bias → increase `WEIGHT_FNO`.
* To loosen liquidity limits, lower `MIN_VOLUMN_AVG` (e.g., `1e5` = 1 lakh).
* Enable or disable candlestick confirmation by toggling:

  ```python
  CONFIG.ENABLE_CANDLE_FILTER = True  # or False
  ```
* Use the `skip_reason` patch to understand why a stock was excluded.

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

* Add **News / FinBERT sentiment** overlay
* Include **VWAP / ADX filters** for trend confirmation
* Automate daily run & export to **Telegram / dashboard**

### Author Notes

Designed for **Indian NSE intraday trading**, compatible with your existing Groww / Kite data pipelines.
All factors are modular — you can turn them on/off or adjust weights per your trading style.

Would you like me to make this README automatically generated (so it includes the current config values dynamically each time you run the script)?
