# Capstone Project Overview

Welcome to the AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning. In this advanced course, you will apply deep learning techniques to solve a real-world geospatial image classification problem. Using Keras and PyTorch, you will develop, train, and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers, gaining hands-on experience in model optimization, performance analysis, and technical reporting.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, learners should have completed the following courses from the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate (PC)** or the **IBM Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow PC**. These courses build the foundational skills necessary for working with deep learning frameworks, designing neural network architectures, and evaluating model performance—essential for tackling the real-world challenges in this capstone:

- Machine Learning with Python
- Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
- Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow
- Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch
- Deep Learning with PyTorch

Completing these courses will equip you with the necessary skills in CNNs, transfer learning, model evaluation metrics, and deep learning frameworks, critical for success in this capstone project.

## Course Objectives

After completing this capstone course, you will have:

- Hands-on experience building deep learning models using Keras and PyTorch to solve real-world image classification problems
- Expertise in designing and implementing a complete deep learning pipeline, including data loading, augmentation, and model validation
- Practical skills in applying CNNs and vision transformers to domain-specific challenges like geospatial land classification
- The ability to communicate project outcomes effectively through model evaluation

## Project Scenario

You are an AI Engineer working at a fertilizer company tasked with building a land classification system for agricultural applications. Using satellite imagery, your goal is to develop models that can accurately classify different types of terrain (e.g., crops, forests, water bodies). This project will involve:

- **Data preprocessing**: Loading and augmenting geospatial image datasets
- **Model development**: Designing CNNs and vision transformers in Keras and PyTorch
- **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models for improved accuracy
- **Performance evaluation**: Comparing models using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AU-ROC
- **Technical reporting**: Documenting your methodology, results, and insights in a final project report

## Capstone Project: Phases and Tasks

This project is structured into four modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of deep learning development.

### Module 1: Data Handling

**Objective**: Learn efficient data loading and augmentation techniques for image datasets

**Tasks**:
- Implement memory-based vs. generator-based data loading
- Apply data augmentation using Keras and PyTorch
- Build a custom geospatial data loader for model training

### Module 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development

**Objective**: Design and train CNN models for agricultural land classification

**Tasks**:
- Develop Keras-based and PyTorch-based CNN models
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall
- Compare the strengths of each framework

### Module 3: CNN - Vision Transformer Integration

**Objective**: Implement vision transformers and apply transfer learning

**Tasks**:
- Fine-tune pre-trained transformer models in Keras and PyTorch
- Compare vision transformer performance against CNNs

### Module 4: Final Project and Course Wrap-Up

**Objective**: Consolidate your work into a comprehensive solution

**Tasks**:
- Conduct a comparative analysis of CNN and vision transformer models
- Submit a final project report with performance insights
- Reflect on key learnings and future applications

## Final Outcome

By the end of this capstone, you will have:

- Built and trained CNN and vision transformer models for geospatial classification
- Applied transfer learning to enhance model performance
- Evaluated models using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, AU-ROC)
- Produced a professional report summarizing your methodology and results

## Grading and Deliverables

Your work will be assessed based on:

- Functional deep learning models (CNNs and vision transformers)
- Proper data handling (loading, augmentation, preprocessing)
- Model evaluation (quantitative metrics and comparative analysis)

In Module 4, you will submit:

- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating lab outputs and model training, evaluated for clarity, insights, and technical rigor

> **Note**: To get the best experience, you might find it faster to download the lab notebooks and run them on your own machine. Training and testing deep learning models can require significant computing resources, and the shared online lab environment in this course has limited capacity, which may lead to slower performance.
