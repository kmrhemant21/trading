# Practice activity: Creating an AI/ML development plan for a fictitious project

## Introduction

In this activity, you will create a comprehensive AI/ML development plan for a specific fictitious project. The goal is to apply the concepts you've learned—such as data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment—to outline a complete workflow for building an ML solution.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Create a comprehensive AI/ML development plan that encompasses the entire workflow of building an ML solution, from defining the problem to deploying and maintaining the model. 
- Understand critical concepts such as data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, and deployment strategies in the context of a practical, real-world scenario.

## Step-by-step instructions:

### Step 1: Understand the project

You will be tasked with developing an ML solution for the following fictitious project:

#### Project overview

A retail company wants to implement an AI-based system that can predict customer churn. The company has historical data on customer purchases, interactions with the customer service team, and subscription status. Your goal is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

### Step 2: Define the problem statement

Write a clear problem statement based on the project. Think about the key objectives and the business problem you're solving. 

Consider:

- What are you trying to predict? (e.g., predicting customer churn)
- Why is it important to the business? (e.g., reducing churn can increase revenue and customer retention)
- What are the expected outputs? (e.g., a list of customers at risk of churning, with predictions of their likelihood to churn)

### Step 3: Outline data requirements

Identify the data you'll need for this project. Based on the project description, determine what types of data you'll use, how you'll collect it, and how you'll prepare it for model development. Consider:

- Data sources: customer demographics, purchase history, customer service interaction logs, subscription information.
- Data types: numerical data (e.g., number of purchases), categorical data (e.g., customer status), and text data (e.g., customer service feedback).
- Data preprocessing: cleaning the data (handling missing values), transforming variables, and encoding categorical features.

Write out the steps for data collection and preprocessing in your plan.

### Step 4: Choose an ML approach

Decide on the types of ML models you will experiment with to solve this problem. 

Consider:

- Model selection: would you use classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests for churn prediction? Why?
- Feature engineering: what additional features could be created from the existing data to improve model performance? For example, this could be customer tenure or frequency of interactions with customer service.
- Cross-validation: How will you split your data (e.g., training and testing sets) to ensure the model generalizes well to new data?

Write out your model selection rationale and outline the plan for experimenting with different models.

### Step 5: Determine model evaluation metrics

Determine how you will evaluate the performance of your model. As this is a classification problem, think about the most appropriate metrics:

- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic curve-area under curve (ROC-AUC) score for classification tasks.
- Overfitting prevention: how will you prevent overfitting? Will you use techniques such as cross-validation or regularization?

In your plan, explain which metrics you will use to measure success and how you will compare the performance of different models.

### Step 6: Plan for deployment

Consider how the ML model will be deployed into a production environment. This step involves moving from model development to integrating the model into the company's workflow. 

Include:

- Deployment platform: will you deploy the model using cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? How will the model interact with the company's CRM system or customer service platform?
- Integration: how will the predictions be delivered to the marketing or customer service teams to take action on customers at risk of churning? Will this be through an API or a dashboard?

Describe your plan for deploying the model and how it will be integrated into business operations.

### Step 7: Monitor and maintain

After deployment, the model will require continuous monitoring to ensure it continues to perform well. 

Consider:

- Monitoring: what tools will you use to monitor the model's performance? Will you track metrics such as accuracy or precision over time?
- Retraining: when will you retrain the model? How often will new data be incorporated into the model to improve its predictions?

In your plan, outline how you will monitor the model's performance and any retraining processes you will put in place.

## Deliverables

By the end of this activity, you should create a detailed AI/ML development plan (approximately 400-500 words) that includes:

- Problem statement: a clear description of the business problem and the goal of the AI/ML solution.
- Data requirements: a list of the data needed, how it will be processed, and any feature engineering considerations.
- ML approach: the models you will use, your rationale for choosing them, and your plan for evaluating their performance.
- Model deployment: a description of how the model will be deployed and integrated into the company's operations.
- Monitoring and maintenance: a plan for monitoring the model's performance after deployment and retraining it as necessary.

## Conclusion

In this activity, you have crafted a detailed AI/ML development plan for a fictitious project focused on predicting customer churn in a retail setting. By applying the concepts learned throughout this course, you have gained valuable insights into the essential steps required to transform a business problem into a deployable ML solution. As you continue your journey in AI/ML engineering, remember that the ability to effectively plan and execute these projects is key to driving successful outcomes in real-world applications. Keep exploring and refining your skills, as the field of AI/ML is continuously evolving.
