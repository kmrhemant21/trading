## 🟢 **What is a Candlestick?**

A **candlestick** is a visual representation of price movement for a specific period (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 hour) on a price chart.
Candlestick charts are the most popular way to visualize stock, forex, or crypto market data.

## 🟩 **The Anatomy of a Candlestick**

A candlestick is made up of **four prices** for a period:

* **Open:** The price at the start of the period
* **High:** The highest price during the period
* **Low:** The lowest price during the period
* **Close:** The price at the end of the period

**Structure:**

```
         High
          │
       ┌─────┐
       │     │  ← Upper Shadow/Wick
 Close ─     │
       │     │
       └─────┘
         Open
          │
         Low
```

* **Body:** The thick part, between Open and Close
* **Wick (Shadow):** The thin lines above and below the body, showing the high and low

## 🟥 **Color/Type of Candlestick**

* **Bullish Candle (Green/White):**

  * **Close > Open** (price rose in this period)
  * Body usually shown as green (or white)
* **Bearish Candle (Red/Black):**

  * **Open > Close** (price fell in this period)
  * Body usually shown as red (or black)

## 🟨 **How Traders Use Candlesticks**

1. **Spotting reversals:**

   * Look for reversal patterns at support/resistance zones
2. **Identifying trend continuations:**

   * Continuation patterns confirm ongoing trends
3. **Setting stop-loss and entry:**

   * Wicks and bodies help define risk/reward zones

---

## 🟪 **Timeframe**

* **Candlestick “duration”** depends on chart settings:

  * **Daily chart:** Each candle is 1 day
  * **Weekly:** Each is 1 week
  * **15-min:** Each is 15 minutes
* Same rules apply for reading the candle—just the time window changes.

---

## 🟫 **Why Are Candlesticks So Popular?**

* Visually simple, but information-rich
* Show **open, high, low, close** at a glance
* Make it easy to spot trends, reversals, and indecision
