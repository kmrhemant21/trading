These models are capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from generating coherent text to answering questions and summarizing information. Their effectiveness, however, is not without limitations. One significant constraint is the context window length, which affects how much information can be processed at once. LLMs operate within a fixed context window, measured in tokens, with GPT-3 having a limit of 4096 tokens and GPT-4 extending to 8192 tokens. When dealing with lengthy documents, attempting to input the entire text into the model's prompt can lead to truncation, where essential information is lost, and increased computational costs due to the processing of large inputs.\n","\n","These limitations become particularly pronounced when creating a retrieval-based question-answering (QA) assistant. The context length constraint restricts the ability to input all content into the prompt simultaneously, leading to potential loss of critical context and details. This necessitates the development of sophisticated strategies for selectively retrieving and processing relevant sections of the document. Techniques such as chunking the document into manageable parts, employing summarization methods, and using external retrieval systems are crucial to address these challenges. Understanding and mitigating these limitations are essential for designing effective QA systems that leverage the full potential of LLMs while navigating their inherent constraints.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"041615a8-c268-4158-b422-be3a63b55984","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Build-LLM\">Build LLM</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Load-source-document\">Load source document</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Limitation-of-retrieve-directly-from-full-document\">Limitation of retrieve directly from full document</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Context-length\">Context length</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#LangChain-prompt-template\">LangChain prompt template</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Use-mixtral-model\">Use mixtral model</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Use-Llama-3-model\">Use Llama 3 model</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Use-one-piece-of-information\">Use one piece of information</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n","\n","<a href=\"#Exercises\">Exercises</a>\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise-1---Change-to-use-another-LLM\">Exercise 1 - Change to use another LLM</a></li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"18a41195-559b-4141-877e-7444ff308b5d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you will be able to:\n","\n"," - Explain the concept of context length for LLMs.\n"," - Recognize the limitations of retrieving information when inputting the entire content of a document into a prompt.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1daf7fc1-83f0-44c2-aa97-1b8d8208cd70","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["----\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"35d49f66-9990-43d7-b9b8-5bfd106cd098","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"03a32d5e-2dcc-46bd-b66d-3603351d3bed","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, you will use the following libraries:\n","\n","*   [`ibm-watson-ai`](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/index.html) for using LLMs from IBM's watsonx.ai.\n","*   [`langchain`, `langchain-ibm`, `langchain-community`](https://www.langchain.com/) for using relevant features from LangChain.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d99f3985-6db2-45b0-9025-d6b3749df62d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Installing required libraries\n","\n","The following required libraries are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the following cell__ to install them:\n","\n","**Note:** The version is being pinned here to specify the version.
