By the end of this reading, you will be able to:
- Describe several AI/ML engineer roles.

## AI/ML engineering key responsibilities

### Data collection and preprocessing 
AI/ML engineers are responsible for collecting and preparing the required data to train ML models. They work with raw data in this phase, cleaning and transforming it into a form that ML algorithms can use effectively. Data preprocessing is critical to ensure the training of models on high-quality, relevant data.

#### Key tasks
- **Data collection**: Gathering data from multiple sources such as databases, sensors, APIs, web scraping, or cloud services. Engineers also handle large volumes of historical data in industries such as finance or healthcare.

- **Data cleaning**: Removing noise, inconsistencies, and errors from the dataset. This could involve handling missing values, correcting errors in data points, or normalizing data types.

- **Data transformation**: Engineers create relevant features from raw data (feature engineering), scaling or normalizing values, and encoding categorical variables for use in ML models.

#### Tools and techniques: 
- **Tools**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SQL`, `Hadoop`, and `Spark` for data handling and querying
- **Techniques**: data normalization, outlier detection, feature extraction, and data augmentation (especially in image and text data)

#### Example
An AI/ML engineer may collect customer behavior data from website interactions (clicks, purchases, etc.) in e-commerce and prepare this data for building a recommendation system.

### Model development and training 
AI/ML engineers focus on building ML models after collecting and preprocessing the data. This involves selecting the right algorithms, designing model architectures, and training the models to learn from the data.

#### Key tasks
- **Algorithm selection**: Engineers choose the appropriate ML algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression, or clustering). They may use decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks depending on the use case.

- **Model training**: AI/ML engineers feed the data into the chosen model and iteratively train it to learn the patterns in the data. They tune parameters and adjust learning rates to ensure the model learns effectively.

- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Engineers fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, or number of layers in a neural network) to optimize model performance.

#### Tools and frameworks:
- `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, and `Keras` are the most popular frameworks for model development. 
- Automated ML tools can help streamline model selection and tuning processes.

#### Example
An AI/ML engineer may develop a model to predict patient outcomes based on historical medical data in healthcare—for example, predicting heart disease based on patient health records using a logistic regression model.

### Model evaluation and validation 
AI/ML engineers must evaluate the performance of a model once training occurs to ensure it meets accuracy and reliability requirements. Model evaluation is essential to avoid deploying a model that doesn't generalize well to new data or overfits the training data.

#### Key tasks
- **Model evaluation**: It is the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification tasks), or mean squared error (for regression tasks) to evaluate model performance.

- **Cross-validation**: Engineers use techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- **Handling overfitting/underfitting**: The engineer must take steps to prevent overfitting (e.g., using regularization techniques or dropout in neural networks) if the model performs well on the training data but poorly on test data.

#### Tools and techniques: 
- Libraries such as `scikit-learn` offer built-in functions to compute evaluation metrics.
- **Techniques**: Grid search, random search, and cross-validation for model tuning

#### Example
An AI/ML engineer might use precision and recall metrics in fraud detection to evaluate a model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

### Model deployment and integration 
AI/ML engineers don't just build models; they also deploy them into production environments where the models interact with real-time data and users. This involves integrating the models into existing applications, ensuring they run efficiently and are scalable across different environments.

#### Key tasks
- **Deploying models**: Engineers deploy models to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud AI) or on-premise systems. This may involve setting up APIs for models to receive new data and provide predictions in real time.

- **Model monitoring**: You need to monitor deployed models continuously to ensure they perform well over time. Engineers set up monitoring tools to track key metrics such as latency, response time, and prediction accuracy.

- **Scaling solutions**: AI/ML engineers ensure that the system is scalable and can handle increasing volumes of data or users. This is crucial in industries such as retail or finance, where data and demand can grow rapidly.

#### Tools and platforms:
- `Docker` and `Kubernetes` for containerization and orchestration
- MLOps practices for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of models

#### Example
An AI/ML engineer might deploy a model in autonomous driving that processes data from car sensors in real time to make decisions like braking or steering. This system must be fast and scalable to ensure safe operation.

### Ongoing model maintenance and monitoring 
AI/ML models require ongoing maintenance even after deployment. Engineers are responsible for monitoring model performance, detecting when models degrade (model drift), and retraining models to maintain accuracy over time.

#### Key tasks
- **Monitoring for model drift**: The performance of a model may decline over time as the underlying data changes (known as model drift). Engineers set up monitoring systems to detect drift and take corrective actions such as retraining the model.

- **Retraining models**: Engineers collect new data and retrain the model when necessary to ensure it remains relevant and accurate in changing environments.

- **Automated retraining pipelines**: Engineers implement automated workflows that trigger model retraining when performance drops below a certain threshold.

#### Tools and techniques: 
- `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, and `TensorBoard` for model performance monitoring
- MLOps tools such as `MLflow` or `Kubeflow` for continuous model maintenance

#### Example
An AI/ML engineer might retrain models for stock price prediction in financial markets as market conditions and trends evolve. 

### Collaboration and cross-functional work 
AI/ML engineers work in interdisciplinary teams, collaborating with data scientists, software developers, and business stakeholders to ensure the AI/ML solutions meet both technical and business goals.

#### Key tasks
- **Collaborating with data scientists**: Engineers work with data scientists to select algorithms, define model architecture, and analyze results.

- **Working with software developers**: Engineers collaborate with developers to ensure seamless integration of ML models into applications, ensuring the systems work together efficiently.

- **Communicating with stakeholders**: AI/ML engineers need to communicate model results and business impact to non-technical stakeholders, helping them understand how AI solutions can drive business value.

#### Example
AI/ML engineers may collaborate with marketing teams in retail to build recommendation systems that suggest products based on customer data, improving customer engagement and sales.
