## Key deep learning techniques

### Feedforward neural networks

#### Overview

A feedforward neural network (FNN) is the simplest form of neural network. In these networks, information flows in one direction—from the input layer, through the hidden layers, to the output layer—without any feedback loops.

#### Key features

* **Architecture**: composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

* **Activation functions**: these introduce non-linearity into the network. Common activation functions include Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Sigmoid.

* **Training**: feedforward networks are trained using backpropagation, where the error is propagated backward through the network to update the weights.

#### Applications

* **Image classification**: image classification is the process of identifying and categorizing objects within an image, using algorithms that assign labels to specific features. For example, in a system that recognizes animals, an image classification model can distinguish between a cat, dog, or bird based on visual characteristics. A common real-world use is in medical imaging, where AI helps classify X-rays or MRIs as normal or showing signs of disease.

* **Simple regression tasks**: simple regression involves predicting a continuous value based on input variables, typically using linear regression to model the relationship. For example, predicting house prices based on factors such as square footage or location uses regression to estimate the expected price. A real-world example includes forecasting sales based on past data, helping businesses plan inventory or budget allocations.

#### Example

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Simple feedforward neural network
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Convolutional neural networks

#### Overview

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to detect patterns automatically in data, such as edges, textures, and shapes.

#### Key features

* **Convolutional layers**: these layers apply filters (kernels) that slide over the input data, producing feature maps.

* **Pooling layers**: these layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, which decreases the computational load and helps the network focus on the most important features.

* **Fully connected layers**: these layers are usually at the end of the network to perform classification or regression tasks.

#### Applications

* **Image classification**

* **Object detection**: object detection goes beyond classification by identifying and locating objects within an image, and drawing bounding boxes around them. For example, in self-driving cars, object detection is used to identify pedestrians, traffic lights, and other vehicles in real time. A common application is security surveillance, where cameras detect and track intruders in real time.

* **Video analysis**: video analysis processes video data to extract insights, such as recognizing actions, events, or patterns over time. For instance, in sports broadcasting, video analysis can track players' movements and analyze game strategies in real time. Another example is traffic monitoring, where video analysis is used to detect accidents or measure traffic flow.

#### Example

```python
# Convolutional Neural Network
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Recurrent neural networks

#### Overview

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data, such as time series or language. Unlike FNNs, RNNs maintain a "memory" of previous inputs by passing the output of one layer back into the network.

#### Key features

* **Hidden state**: this maintains the context of previous inputs in the network.

* **Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs)**: these are advanced RNN architectures that address the problem of long-term dependencies, making them effective at capturing information over long sequences.

#### Applications

* **Time-series forecasting**

* **Natural language processing, such as language translation and sentiment analysis**

#### Example

```python
# Simple RNN
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.SimpleRNN(128, input_shape=(100, 1)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Generative adversarial networks

#### Overview

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously. The generator creates fake data, and the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated data. Over time, the generator improves its ability to produce realistic data.

#### Key features

* **Generator**: learns to create data that is indistinguishable from real data.

* **Discriminator**: learns to distinguish between real and generated data.

* **Adversarial training**: the two networks compete with each other, leading to better results over time.

#### Applications

* **Image generation**: image generation uses algorithms to create new images from scratch based on input data, often employing techniques such as GANs. For instance, AI can generate realistic images of faces that don't belong to any real person. A common application is in art, where AI generates original artworks or designs based on style preferences.

* **Style transfer**: style transfer involves applying the artistic style of one image to the content of another, creating a blend of both. For example, AI can take a photo of a cityscape and apply the painting style of Van Gogh, transforming it into a starry, impressionistic version. This technique is used in digital art and content creation to stylize photos or videos.

* **Data augmentation for training models**: data augmentation artificially expands a dataset by creating modified versions of the existing data, such as by rotating, cropping, or flipping images. For instance, in image recognition tasks, augmenting a dataset of dog photos by flipping or zooming in on them helps improve the model's accuracy. This technique is essential for preventing overfitting in machine learning models and improving generalization.

#### Example

```python
# GAN architecture (simplified)
generator = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')
])

discriminator = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

### Autoencoders

#### Overview

Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models used for data compression. They consist of an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the original data from this representation.

#### Key features

* **Encoder**: compresses the data into a lower-dimensional space.

* **Decoder**: reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.

* **Bottleneck layer**: this is the low-dimensional representation, also called the latent space.

#### Applications

* **Dimensionality reduction**: dimensionality reduction reduces the number of features in a dataset while retaining essential information, simplifying the data for analysis. For example, using principal component analysis in a dataset with hundreds of features (such as gene expression data) can reduce it to a few key dimensions for easier visualization. This technique is often used in fields such as bioinformatics or finance to avoid overfitting and improve computational efficiency.

* **Anomaly detection**: anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns or data points that deviate from the norm, often used in monitoring and fraud detection. For example, in credit card transactions, anomaly detection algorithms flag suspicious activities such as unusually high purchases or transactions from uncommon locations. This method helps detect fraud, equipment malfunctions, or cybersecurity threats in real time.

* **Data denoising**: data denoising removes noise or irrelevant information from data to improve its quality and make it more usable for analysis. For instance, in image processing, denoising algorithms remove graininess or distortions in pictures captured under poor lighting conditions. It's commonly used in audio, video, and image processing to enhance the clarity and accuracy of data.

#### Example

```python
# Simple Autoencoder
input_img = layers.Input(shape=(784,))
encoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_img)
decoded = layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)

autoencoder = models.Model(input_img, decoded)
```
