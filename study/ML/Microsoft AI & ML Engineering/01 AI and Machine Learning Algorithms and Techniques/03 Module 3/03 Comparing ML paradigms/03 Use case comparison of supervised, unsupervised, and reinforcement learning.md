# Use case comparison of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI and ML, understanding the nuances of different learning paradigms is essential for tackling a variety of real-world problems. Each learning paradigm has strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of tasks. We'll analyze three distinct use cases to understand when and why each approach should be used.

By the end of this reading, you will be able to: 

- Compare how supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and RL perform in different real-world use cases. 

## Use case 1: Predicting house prices (supervised learning)

### Overview
Supervised learning is ideal for problems where you have labeled data and the goal is to map input features to an output label. In this case, we are tasked with predicting house prices based on features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location.

### Best learning paradigm
**Supervised learning**: here, each house in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding price, which allows us to use regression algorithms such as linear regression or random forest regression to predict prices for new houses.

**Key metrics**: the success of this model is evaluated using MSE, which measures how close the predicted prices are to the actual prices.

### Why not unsupervised learning or RL?
**Unsupervised learning**: this paradigm would be inappropriate because the task requires exact price predictions, not discovering clusters or patterns. Clustering similar houses might help with market segmentation but will not provide accurate price predictions.

**RL**: there is no sequential decision-making or environment interaction involved in this task, making RL unnecessary. The model only needs to make static predictions, not learn through trial and error.

### Outcome
Supervised learning is the clear choice for this task, as it uses labeled data to create a predictive model, and evaluation is straightforward with metrics such as MSE.

## Use case 2: Customer segmentation (unsupervised learning)

### Overview
A company wants to group its customers based on their purchasing behavior in order to better target marketing strategies. There are no predefined labels for these groups, which makes it a perfect use case for unsupervised learning.

### Best learning paradigm
**Unsupervised learning**: the goal here is to discover hidden patterns in the data. A clustering algorithm, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, can group customers based on similar behaviors, such as spending habits, frequency of purchases, and product categories.

**Key metrics**: one way to evaluate the quality of the clusters is by using the silhouette score, which measures how similar each customer is to its assigned cluster compared to other clusters.

### Why not supervised learning or RL?
**Supervised learning**: as there are no labeled outcomes in this task, supervised learning cannot be applied. We do not know which cluster a customer belongs to beforehand, so we cannot train the model with labeled data.

**RL**: there is no interactive environment in which an agent is rewarded for discovering the best segmentation strategy. The task is static, involving pattern discovery rather than decision-making over time.

### Outcome
Unsupervised learning is the most suitable approach for this task because it excels at discovering natural groupings within data without the need for labeled outputs.

## Use case 3: Training an AI to play tic-tac-toe (RL)

### Overview
In this use case, we want to train an AI agent to play the game of tic-tac-toe. The agent will interact with the game environment, making decisions about where to place its mark (X or O) and receiving rewards based on the outcome of the game.

### Learning paradigm
**RL**: the agent learns by exploring different strategies and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Using a Q-learning algorithm, the agent updates its policy based on the rewards it accumulates, aiming to maximize its chances of winning future games.

**Key metrics**: success is evaluated using cumulative rewards and win rates. The agent's policy is refined as it learns to take actions that lead to more wins over time.

### Why not supervised or unsupervised learning?
**Supervised learning**: there is no labeled dataset for training. The AI cannot learn simply by being shown winning tic-tac-toe boards; it needs to interact with the environment, make decisions, and learn from the outcomes.

**Unsupervised learning**: there is no clustering or pattern discovery task here. The goal is to make optimal decisions based on trial and error, not to find patterns within the game's structure.

### Outcome
RL is the most appropriate method for training an agent to play tic-tac-toe, as it allows the AI to learn optimal strategies through trial and error, receiving feedback after each action.

## Comparative analysis of learning paradigms

| Use case | Supervised learning | Unsupervised learning | RL |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|-----|
| Predicting house prices | Best choice for labeled data and making predictions based on features | Inappropriate, as clustering won't provide price predictions | Inappropriate, as there is no interaction or feedback mechanism |
| Customer segmentation | Inappropriate, as there are no labels for each customer segment | Best choice for discovering patterns in customer behavior | Inappropriate, as there is no reward-based learning or sequential decision-making |
| Playing tic-tac-toe | Inappropriate, as there are no labels for optimal actions in each game state | Inappropriate, as the goal is not to find clusters or patterns | Best choice for learning strategies through trial and error, maximizing long-term rewards |

## Conclusion

Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and RL each have their strengths and are suited to different types of problems:

- Supervised learning is ideal for tasks with labeled data where the goal is to predict an output based on known inputs.

- Unsupervised learning excels at discovering hidden structures or patterns in data where labels are not available.

- RL is the best choice when an agent needs to make sequential decisions and learn through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

By understanding the characteristics of each learning paradigm and applying them to appropriate use cases, ML practitioners can develop more effective models for solving a wide range of problems.
