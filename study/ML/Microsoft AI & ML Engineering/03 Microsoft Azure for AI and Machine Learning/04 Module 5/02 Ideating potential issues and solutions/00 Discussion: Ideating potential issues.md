# Discussion: Ideating potential issues

## Discussion prompt
Securing machine learning environments is a critical aspect of successful deployments. For this discussion, reflect on the practice activity in which you matched unsecured environments to appropriate remediation strategies. Consider the challenges you faced, the strategies you employed, and how these insights could be applied in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to share your reflections, including any additional security measures you believe could enhance deployment security. Specific examples and thoughtful insights can help foster a rich learning experience for the community.

## Reflection questions:
1. Which of the situations described in the practice activity did you find the most challenging to match with a remediation strategy, and why?

2. How do you think implementing these remediation strategies would impact the security of a machine learning deployment in a real-world scenario?

3. Are there any additional security measures that could have been applied to these situations that were not listed in the activity? If so, describe them.

4. What was your key takeaway from this activity regarding the importance of securing machine learning environments?
