# TA-Lib Statistic Functions Explained

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each TA-Lib statistic function and how they're used in financial analysis:

## **BETA - Beta Coefficient**

**What it measures**: Beta measures the volatility or systematic risk of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.

**Formula**: β = Covariance(Asset, Market) / Variance(Market)

**Usage**:

```python
import talib
import yfinance as yf

# Download stock and market data
stock = yf.download('AAPL', period='1y')['Close']
market = yf.download('SPY', period='1y')['Close']  # S&P 500 as market proxy

beta = talib.BETA(stock, market, timeperiod=14)
```

**Interpretation**:

- **Beta = 1**: Stock moves with the market
- **Beta > 1**: Stock is more volatile than market (high risk, high reward)
- **Beta < 1**: Stock is less volatile than market (defensive)
- **Beta < 0**: Stock moves opposite to market (rare)


## **CORREL - Pearson's Correlation Coefficient**

**What it measures**: The linear relationship between two price series, ranging from -1 to +1.

**Usage**:

```python
correlation = talib.CORREL(stock1, stock2, timeperiod=20)
```

**Interpretation**:

- **+1**: Perfect positive correlation
- **0**: No linear relationship
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation
- **0.7 to 1**: Strong positive correlation
- **-0.7 to -1**: Strong negative correlation

**Trading Application**: Portfolio diversification, pairs trading strategies.

## **LINEARREG - Linear Regression**

**What it measures**: Calculates the linear regression line value for each point, showing the "best fit" trend line.

**Usage**:

```python
linear_reg = talib.LINEARREG(close_prices, timeperiod=14)
```

**Trading Application**:

- Trend identification
- Support/resistance levels
- Price deviation analysis


## **LINEARREG_ANGLE - Linear Regression Angle**

**What it measures**: The angle (in degrees) of the linear regression line, indicating trend strength and direction.

**Usage**:

```python
angle = talib.LINEARREG_ANGLE(close_prices, timeperiod=14)
```

**Interpretation**:

- **Positive angle**: Uptrend (the steeper, the stronger)
- **Negative angle**: Downtrend
- **Near 0**: Sideways/consolidating market

**Trading Application**: Quantifying trend strength, identifying trend changes.

## **LINEARREG_INTERCEPT - Linear Regression Intercept**

**What it measures**: The y-intercept of the linear regression line (where the line crosses the y-axis).

**Usage**:

```python
intercept = talib.LINEARREG_INTERCEPT(close_prices, timeperiod=14)
```

**Trading Application**: Combined with slope to construct the complete regression equation for forecasting.

## **LINEARREG_SLOPE - Linear Regression Slope**

**What it measures**: The slope of the linear regression line, indicating the rate of change per period.

**Usage**:

```python
slope = talib.LINEARREG_SLOPE(close_prices, timeperiod=14)
```

**Interpretation**:

- **Positive slope**: Price is trending upward
- **Negative slope**: Price is trending downward
- **Magnitude**: Indicates speed of price change

**Trading Application**: Momentum analysis, trend strength measurement.

## **STDDEV - Standard Deviation**

**What it measures**: The amount of variation or dispersion of price from the average price.

**Usage**:

```python
std_dev = talib.STDDEV(close_prices, timeperiod=20, nbdev=1)
```

**Interpretation**:

- **High std dev**: High volatility, risky asset
- **Low std dev**: Low volatility, stable asset
- **~68%** of data falls within 1 standard deviation
- **~95%** of data falls within 2 standard deviations

**Trading Application**:

- Volatility measurement
- Risk assessment
- Bollinger Bands calculation
- Options pricing


## **TSF - Time Series Forecast**

**What it measures**: Projects the next period's price using linear regression extrapolation.

**Usage**:

```python
forecast = talib.TSF(close_prices, timeperiod=14)
```

**How it works**: Uses the linear regression trend to predict where the price should be in the next period.

**Trading Application**:

- Price target estimation
- Identifying overbought/oversold conditions
- Trend continuation signals


## **VAR - Variance**

**What it measures**: The average of the squared differences from the mean (standard deviation squared).

**Usage**:

```python
variance = talib.VAR(close_prices, timeperiod=20, nbdev=1)
```

**Relationship**: Variance = (Standard Deviation)²

**Trading Application**:

- Risk measurement
- Portfolio optimization
- Volatility analysis


## **Practical Trading Example**

Here's how you might combine these functions in a trading strategy:

```python
import talib
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Get data
df = yf.download('AAPL', period='1y')
close = df['Close']

# Calculate statistics
beta = talib.BETA(close, market_close, timeperiod=20)
correlation = talib.CORREL(close, market_close, timeperiod=20)
linear_reg = talib.LINEARREG(close, timeperiod=20)
slope = talib.LINEARREG_SLOPE(close, timeperiod=20)
angle = talib.LINEARREG_ANGLE(close, timeperiod=20)
std_dev = talib.STDDEV(close, timeperiod=20)
forecast = talib.TSF(close, timeperiod=20)

# Create signals
trend_strength = abs(angle)  # Higher = stronger trend
volatility = std_dev / close * 100  # Volatility as percentage
trend_direction = slope > 0  # True for uptrend

# Trading logic
buy_signal = (
    trend_direction &  # Uptrend
    (trend_strength > 30) &  # Strong trend
    (close < forecast)  # Price below forecast (potential bounce)
)
```


## **Key Takeaways**

1. **BETA \& CORREL**: Measure relationships between assets
2. **Linear Regression functions**: Analyze trends and predict future prices
3. **STDDEV \& VAR**: Measure volatility and risk
4. **TSF**: Provides price forecasts based on historical trends

These statistical functions are powerful tools for **quantitative analysis**, **risk management**, and **systematic trading strategies**. They help transform subjective chart analysis into objective, measurable metrics.
