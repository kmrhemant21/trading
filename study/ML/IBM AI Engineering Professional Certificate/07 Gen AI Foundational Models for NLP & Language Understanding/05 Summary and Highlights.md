# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

- A **bi-gram model** is a conditional probability model with context size one, that is, you consider only the immediate previous word to predict the next one.

- A **trigram model** is also a conditional probability function and can improve on the bigram model's limitations by increasing the context size to two.

- The concept of a trigram can be generalized to an **N-gram model**, which allows for an arbitrary context size.

- In neural network-based n-gram models, the input vector's dimensionality is often described as the product of the vocabulary size and the context size—if one-hot encodings are used. However, in practice, this high-dimensional representation is avoided by using embedding vectors, and the context vector is typically formed by concatenating the embeddings of the preceding words.

- An N-gram model allows for an arbitrary context size.

- In PyTorch, the n-gram language model is essentially a classification model, using the context vector and an extra hidden layer to enhance performance.

- The n-gram model predicts words surrounding a target by incrementally shifting as a sliding window.

- In training the model, prioritize the **loss** over accuracy as your key performance indicator or KPI.
