There’s no one-size-fits-all answer—it really comes down to the trade-off between **resolution** and **noise** (and by extension, transaction costs and slippage). Here’s the scoop:

---

## 1m Bars

* **Pros**

  * **Highest resolution.** You’ll pick up very short bursts of momentum.
  * **More signals.** You can get in and out faster if you’re truly HFT-style.
* **Cons**

  * **A ton of noise.** Moving-average crossovers on 1 min bars whip-saw you more often.
  * **More trades → higher commissions/slippage.** Each signal costs you in fees and market impact.
  * **Overfitting risk.** You’ll find “patterns” that vanish as soon as you go live.

## 5m Bars

* **Pros**

  * **Smoother price series.** Many of those 1 min blips wash out, so your MA crossovers are more meaningful.
  * **Fewer trades.** Lower transaction costs, less slippage, simpler risk-management.
  * **Easier on data/infrastructure.** Lower download frequency, quicker backtests.
* **Cons**

  * **Less granular.** You might miss very short bursts of opportunity.
  * **Slightly more lag.** Your SMA(20) on 5 min bars is “400 min of data” vs “20 min of data” on 1 min bars—so it reacts more slowly.

## What “Usually” Works for Retail Intraday

* For most **MA-crossover** and **momentum** intraday systems, **5 min bars** tend to give better overall performance (higher Sharpe, fewer false signals) simply because they strike a good balance between responsiveness and noise tolerance.
* If you have **ultra-low latency** (co-located servers, direct market access) and can swallow the extra commission/slippage, you can experiment on **1 min**.

## How to Decide for Your Own Bot

1. **Backtest both timeframes** on your target instrument, with real commissions/slippage.
2. Compare key metrics:

   * Total return & drawdown
   * Win rate & average PnL per trade
   * Sharpe/Sortino
   * Number of trades (and total fees paid)
3. Pick the timeframe that gives the best risk-adjusted return net of costs.

### Quick Python Sketch

If you already have a backtest function (e.g. using Backtrader or VectorBT), you can do something like:

```python
for interval in ['1m','5m']:
    df = yf.download(symbol, period='30d', interval=interval)
    price = df['Close']
    # compute SMA crossover, backtest, record metrics…
    metrics = run_my_backtest(price)
    print(interval, metrics)
```

That simple loop will tell you whether your MA strategy performs better on 1 min or 5 min bars **for your exact rules and costs**.

---

**Bottom line:**

* **Start with 5 min** for a robust, lower-cost intraday MA system.
* **Tune and test 1 min** only if you have the infrastructure and cost-model to support the extra churn.
