# Walkthrough: Multi-agent systems vs. single agent systems (Optional)

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, you'll explore the decision-making process involved in selecting either multiagent or single-agent systems. By understanding the characteristics and applications of each system, you'll gain insight into their suitability for different tasks. Multiagent systems are valuable for complex, dynamic tasks that benefit from cooperation, while single-agent systems are often effective for simpler, independent tasks. Through this activity, you'll practice identifying the best-fit system based on task requirements and environmental factors.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between multiagent and single-agent systems based on their defining characteristics.
- Analyze scenario requirements to determine whether a multiagent or single-agent system is more suitable.
- Support your choices with reasoning, referencing how the system's traits align with task needs.
- Reflect on your decision-making process, including the factors that influenced your choices and any patterns you observed.

## Deciding multiagent vs. single-agent systems

To complete this activity, start by reviewing the key concepts of multiagent and single-agent systems. Multiagent systems involve multiple agents working together, making them ideal for complex, dynamic tasks requiring cooperation or adaptability. In contrast, single-agent systems are suited to simpler tasks that a single entity can handle independently in a stable environment.

As you approach each scenario from the practice activity (warehouse management system, autonomous lawn mower, search-and-rescue operation, customer service chatbot, and autonomous traffic management), focus on the task requirements, the nature of the environment, and the level of autonomy or interaction needed. Determine whether the scenario demands multiple perspectives and collaboration, requiring a multiagent system, or if a single-agent system could manage it without extra coordination.

Once you make your choice, support it by explaining how the chosen system's characteristics align with the task. Reference specific examples, if possible, to clarify your decision. Document your reasoning as you go, noting the factors that influenced your choices.

At the end, summarize your decisions, and reflect on any patterns or challenges you encountered, as well as the insights you gained about using multiagent versus single-agent systems. This final reflection should highlight your decision-making process and show how understanding these systems can support problem-solving across contexts.

## Conclusion

Through this walkthrough, you've enhanced your understanding of when to apply multiagent versus single-agent systems. Evaluating each scenario's task requirements and environmental factors allowed you to make informed decisions, reinforcing your ability to match system characteristics to specific contexts. By documenting your choices and reflecting on your approach, you gained valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of each system type, equipping you with a framework for addressing diverse problem-solving challenges in future applications.
