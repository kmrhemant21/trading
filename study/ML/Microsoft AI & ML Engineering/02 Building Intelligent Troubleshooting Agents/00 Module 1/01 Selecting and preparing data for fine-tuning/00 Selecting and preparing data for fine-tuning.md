# Selecting and preparing data for fine-tuning

## Introduction

The data used for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) is one of the most critical factors in determining the model's success for a specific task. Fine-tuning adapts a pretrained model to specialized tasks, and the dataset's quality, relevance, and preparation are essential for ensuring that the model learns effectively. In this section, we'll cover the key principles for selecting and preparing data, ensuring it is ready for use in fine-tuning.

## Step-by-step process for selecting and preparing data for fine-tuning

This reading will guide you through the following steps:

1. Step 1: Define the task and goals
2. Step 2: Collect the data
3. Step 3: Preprocess the data
4. Step 4: Split the data
5. Step 5: Ensure dataset balance
6. Step 6: Use data augmentation (optional)

### Step 1: Define the task and goals

Before collecting or preparing the dataset, you must clearly define the task the model is being fine-tuned for and the end goals. This ensures the data is aligned with the task's objectives.

#### Task definition

Start by identifying the type of task you're addressing. Are you working on text classification (e.g., spam detection), sentiment analysis (e.g., positive, neutral, or negative feedback), or text summarization? Different tasks will require different types of data.

Define what success looks like. For example, if you're fine-tuning for sentiment analysis, success might be measured by how accurately the model categorizes text into the correct sentiment class.

#### Target domain

Consider the domain in which you're operating. Fine-tuning a model for a medical application will require medical-specific data, while a model for legal document analysis will need legal texts. The model will adapt its knowledge based on the specific domain's language patterns, terminologies, and intricacies.

### Step 2: Collect the data

Once the task and goals are clear, the next step is to collect data that matches the specific task. Data collection can come from various sources, but the focus should always be on obtaining high-quality, task-relevant data.

#### Types of data

- **Labeled data**: if you're working on a supervised learning task, you'll need labeled data in which each data point is tagged with the correct label. For example, a dataset for sentiment analysis would contain sentences labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Unlabeled data**: you may collect unlabeled data in some cases, especially with unsupervised or semisupervised tasks. This data is helpful for training models to recognize patterns or groupings within the text.

- **Synthetic data**: in some cases, it may be helpful to generate synthetic data. You can do this by augmenting the original dataset with paraphrased or modified examples. However, you must take care to ensure the synthetic data does not introduce bias or errors.

#### Sources of data

- **Public datasets**: many publicly available datasets are designed for specific NLP tasks. For example, you can use the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis or the SQuAD dataset for question answering to fine-tune models for similar tasks.

- **Proprietary data**: if the task requires a more specialized approach (e.g., specific customer service dialogues or internal documents), gathering proprietary data from within your organization may be necessary.

### Step 3: Preprocess the data

Preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and formatted for model training. During this step, it's essential to consider the structure and format of the data, as different tasks (e.g., sentence-level vs. paragraph-level analysis) may require specific formatting.

#### Text cleaning

- **Remove noise**: eliminate irrelevant information such as special characters, excessive whitespace, or unstructured metadata (e.g., timestamps in text). Separate conversational turns for conversational data to preserve the flow and context of dialogue.

- **Lowercasing**: convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity and reduce the number of unique tokens the model needs to learn.

- **Stopword removal**: consider removing common words (e.g., "the," "and," and "of") that may not add value to the task. However, in some cases, stopwords may carry meaning (e.g., in sentiment analysis), so assess this based on the task requirements.

#### Text structure considerations

- **Sentence vs. paragraph level**: decide whether the analysis requires sentence-level or paragraph-level data. Sentence-level tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) may require the text to be split into individual sentences, while paragraph-level tasks (e.g., text summarization) should retain entire paragraphs for context.

- **Conversational data**: if your task involves dialogue or conversational data (e.g., customer service transcripts), ensure that conversational turns are separated to maintain context and avoid confusing the model during training.

#### Tokenization

Tokenization breaks down the text into smaller units (words or subwords) that the model can process. Many LLMs use subword tokenization, which splits rare words into smaller, more common parts. The model can handle new or rare words by learning their subparts.

- **Choosing the right tokenizer**: use the tokenizer corresponding to the pretrained model you are fine-tuning. For instance, BERT models have their own tokenizer, which must be used to ensure compatibility with the pretrained model architecture.

#### Handling missing data

Missing or incomplete data is common in real-world datasets. Decide how to handle missing entries: you can fill them with placeholder values, remove them, or use statistical imputation methods to estimate missing content. Ensure that the chosen method fits the task's needs and avoids introducing bias into the dataset.

### Step 4: Split the data

Once the data is preprocessed, you must split it into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

#### Training set

This is the most significant subset, typically 70 percent of the total dataset, and is used to fine-tune the model. The training data teaches the model the patterns and relationships necessary for the task.

#### Validation set

The validation set, usually around 15 percent, is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor the model's performance during fine-tuning. The model's performance on the validation set helps adjust learning rates, batch sizes, and other training parameters.

#### Test set

The final 15 percent of the data is reserved for the test set, which evaluates the model's performance after fine-tuning. This ensures that the model can generalize to unseen data.

### Step 5: Ensure dataset balance

For specific tasks, it's essential to ensure that the dataset is balanced, meaning that each class has roughly equal numbers of examples. Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models that perform well on the majority class but poorly on minority classes. Several techniques address this, and understanding when to apply each, along with their advantages and disadvantages, is crucial.

#### Class balancing techniques

##### Oversampling

- **What it is**: this technique involves increasing the number of examples in the minority class by duplicating existing examples.

- **When to use it**: oversampling is suitable when you have a small minority class and you want to give the model more exposure to these examples without reducing the size of the majority class.

- **Advantages**: this technique ensures that the model has enough data to learn from the minority class, improving its ability to generalize across all classes.

- **Disadvantages**: duplicating examples can lead to overfitting, in which the model learns specific patterns from the duplicated data and struggles with unseen examples.

##### Undersampling

- **What it is**: this technique reduces the number of examples in the majority class to match the size of the minority class.

- **When to use it**: use undersampling when the majority class is overwhelmingly larger than the minority class and the risk of removing some majority examples is acceptable.

- **Advantages**: lowering the dataset size reduces the overall training time and memory requirements. It also prevents the model from being too biased toward the majority class.

- **Disadvantages**: by removing examples from the majority class, you may lose valuable information that could help the model generalize, potentially decreasing overall model performance.

##### Class weights

- **What it is**: instead of adjusting the dataset, this approach involves assigning higher weights to the minority class during training, ensuring that the model pays more attention to underrepresented examples.

- **When to use it**: class weighting is ideal when oversampling and undersampling are not feasible or when you want to retain the entire dataset without duplicating or discarding data.

- **Advantages**: it keeps the dataset intact while allowing the model to focus on underrepresented classes. It also helps avoid the overfitting risk associated with oversampling and retains all the information in the majority class.

- **Disadvantages**: tuning class weights correctly can be more challenging, and improper weighting can lead to the model being overly focused on the minority class, possibly reducing overall accuracy.

### Step 6: Use data augmentation (optional)

Data augmentation involves creating additional training examples by modifying the existing data. This process can improve model robustness, especially when working with smaller datasets. However, it's essential to understand when to use augmentation and the trade-offs involved with each technique.

#### Examples of augmentation

##### Paraphrasing

- **What it is**: paraphrasing involves rewriting sentences differently while maintaining their original meaning.

- **When to use it**: paraphrasing is effective when the dataset is small and you need more training examples without changing the core meaning of the text. It can also help the model generalize better to variations in language use.

- **Advantages**: it increases the variety of examples the model sees, helping it generalize better to new, unseen data. This is particularly useful for tasks involving text generation or summarization.

- **Disadvantages**: there is a risk of introducing subtle changes in meaning, which could confuse the model. Additionally, generating high-quality paraphrases can be time-consuming and may require automated tools that do not always yield accurate results.

##### Back translation

- **What it is**: back translation involves translating a sentence into another language and then back into the original language to create a variation.

- **When to use it**: this technique works well when working with text in multiple languages or when you want to ensure that the sentence's meaning remains intact while altering its structure.

- **Advantages**: back translation creates more diverse examples while preserving the meaning of the text. It can improve model robustness by exposing it to variations in sentence structure.

- **Disadvantages**: the quality of backtranslated sentences depends heavily on the accuracy of the translation models. Poor translations can distort the meaning of the text, which could lead to incorrect model predictions.

##### Synonym replacement

- **What it is**: synonym replacement involves swapping words in the text with their synonyms to create new examples.

- **When to use it**: this technique is useful when creating additional examples for tasks with significant word-level variations, such as text classification and sentiment analysis.

- **Advantages**: synonym replacement generates more training data while keeping the text's overall meaning intact. Compared to other augmentation methods, it's also relatively simple to implement.

- **Disadvantages**: replacing words with synonyms may not permanently preserve the exact meaning, especially in context-specific tasks. Additionally, excessive synonym replacement can lead to unnatural sentence constructions, which could mislead the model during training.

## Conclusion

Selecting and preparing the correct dataset is crucial for effectively fine-tuning an LLM. By ensuring that the data aligns with the specific task and goals and following key steps such as data cleaning, tokenization, splitting, and balancing, you can optimize the model's ability to generalize while specializing in your chosen domain. With proper preparation, including optional techniques such as data augmentation, the model is better equipped to deliver accurate and reliable performance on the specific tasks you are addressing. This preparation ensures that the model can generalize to new, unseen examples while remaining specialized enough to perform the particular task at hand.
