# Practice Project Overview

Welcome to this practice project, where you will create an end-to-end solution using machine learning pipelines for regression. Your objective is to clean the dataset, create a model that predicts the SoundLevel based on the other columns, evaluate its performance, and persist the model for future use.

This project has four parts, each building on the previous one:

## Part 1: ETL Activities
- Load the CSV dataset
- Remove duplicate rows (if any)
- Drop rows with null values
- Apply necessary transformations
- Store the cleaned data in parquet format

## Part 2: Machine Learning Pipeline
Create a machine learning pipeline with three stages, including a regression stage. This pipeline will be the backbone of your model development, enabling you to process the data and train a predictive model efficiently.

## Part 3: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics. This step is crucial in understanding how well your model predicts SoundLevel and identifying areas for improvement.

## Part 4: Model Persistence
- Persist the model for real-world applications
- Load and verify the stored model to ensure integrity and usability

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:
- Data cleaning
- Creating machine learning pipelines
- Evaluating model performance
- Model persistence

This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your skills in building a complete solution from start to finish.
