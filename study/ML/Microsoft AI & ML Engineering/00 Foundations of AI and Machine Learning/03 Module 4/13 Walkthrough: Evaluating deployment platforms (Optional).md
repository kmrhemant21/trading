## 1. Understanding the Project Requirements

### Project Overview

The smart traffic management system is an AI-driven solution designed to optimize traffic flow in a mid-sized city by processing real-time data from IoT sensors, cameras, and GPS devices. The key requirements for the deployment platform include real-time data processing, scalability, cost-effectiveness, integration with existing infrastructure, and robust security measures.

### Key Considerations

- **Real-time data processing**: The platform must handle real-time data streams to adjust traffic light timings dynamically.
- **Scalability**: The system should scale as more sensors and cameras are added or as the solution is expanded to other areas.
- **Cost-efficiency**: The platform should provide a cost-effective solution that aligns with the city’s budget.
- **Integration**: The platform must integrate with the city’s existing traffic management systems and databases.
- **Security**: The platform must offer strong security features to protect sensitive data.
