# Summary and Highlights

In this lesson, you have learned:

## Data Engineer's Ecosystem
A Data Engineer's ecosystem includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks, and processes for:
- Extracting data
- Architecting and managing data pipelines and data repositories
- Managing workflows
- Developing applications
- Managing BI and Reporting tools

## Data Categories
Based on how well-defined the structure of the data is, data can be categorized as:

### Structured Data
Data which is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases.

### Semi-structured Data
Data which is partially organized and partially free-form.

### Unstructured Data
Data which can not be organized conventionally into rows and columns.

## Data File Formats
Data comes in a wide-ranging variety of file formats, such as:
- Delimited text files
- Spreadsheets
- XML
- PDF
- JSON

Each format has its own list of benefits and limitations of use.

## Data Sources
Data is extracted from multiple data sources, including:
- Relational and non-relational databases
- APIs
- Web services
- Data streams
- Social platforms
- Sensor devices

## Data Repository Staging
Once the data is identified and gathered from different sources, it needs to be staged in a data repository so that it can be prepared for analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the type of data repository that can be used.

## Programming Languages for Data Professionals
Data professionals need a host of languages that can help them extract, prepare, and analyse data. These can be classified as:

### Querying Languages
- **SQL**: Used for accessing and manipulating data from databases

### Programming Languages
- **Python, R, and Java**: For developing applications and controlling application behavior

### Shell and Scripting Languages
- **Unix/Linux Shell and PowerShell**: For automating repetitive operational tasks
