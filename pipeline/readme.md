To improve the quality of your swing‑trading signals you generally need filters that confirm the strength of the trend, the momentum behind the move, and the commitment of other market participants.  No single “magic” indicator will guarantee a >50 % win rate, but using a suite of complementary indicators can help you take higher‑probability trades.

Here are some well‑known indicators that you can add to your existing candlestick‑pattern+RSI+MACD+volume framework and why they can help:

| Indicator                                                 | Why it helps / how to use it (cited from primary sources)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Average Directional Index (ADX)**                       | ADX measures the **strength** of a trend regardless of direction. It uses three lines: the ADX line for overall trend strength and DI+ and DI– for trend direction. Readings **above 20** indicate a trend, and values **above 40** denote a strong trend; readings below 20 suggest a weak or range‑bound market. Many traders only take trend‑following trades when ADX is above 40 and avoid trades when it is below 20. Adding an ADX filter can prevent you from entering candlestick setups in choppy markets.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Aroon Indicator**                                       | The Aroon oscillator uses time rather than price to identify when a new trend is beginning. It has two lines—Aroon Up and Aroon Down. When Aroon Up stays above **70** and Aroon Down remains low, it signals a strong uptrend; the opposite signals a downtrend. Crossovers between the lines can herald the start of a new trend. Combining Aroon with volume indicators (like OBV) can increase the likelihood that a trend will continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Stochastic Oscillator**                                 | Like RSI, the stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. It compares the closing price to its recent range to spot potential reversals. Crosses of the %K and %D lines above **80** or below **20** are significant signals; because the oscillator is sensitive, these signals are more reliable when used in the direction of the prevailing trend. A confirmed candlestick pattern followed by a stochastic cross in the same direction can strengthen a setup.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Bollinger Bands**                                       | These bands consist of a moving average and two outer bands at standard‑deviation distances. When price touches the upper band it may be overbought; touching the lower band may indicate oversold conditions. A **“squeeze”** (bands contracting) signals low volatility and often precedes a breakout; wide bands indicate high volatility. Using Bollinger Bands helps you measure volatility and confirm if a candlestick breakout has room to run.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Ease of Movement (EOM)** or **On‑Balance Volume (OBV)** | Both are volume‑based indicators. **EOM** gauges how easily price moves on a given amount of volume. A positive EOM value reflects price moving up easily on less volume and confirms an uptrend; a negative value signals a downtrend. **OBV** is a cumulative volume indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts it on down days. It uses volume flow to anticipate price moves; sharp increases in volume without price change can precede significant moves. Traders watch the slope of OBV to see whether volume is flowing into or out of a security. Either indicator can confirm whether institutional money supports a candlestick signal. |
| **Average True Range (ATR)**                              | ATR measures price **volatility**, not direction. It is the average of the true ranges over a period and tells you how much an asset typically moves each day. Since ATR is not directional, it’s best used with other indicators to set stop‑loss distances and adapt position sizing to volatility. Using ATR‑based stops rather than fixed percentages can prevent being stopped out by normal price noise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Practical considerations

* **Combine only two or three filters:** Even Investopedia cautions that successful traders usually pair a trend filter (e.g., ADX), a momentum oscillator (e.g., RSI or stochastic), and a volume indicator (e.g., OBV) rather than using every indicator available. Too many filters may drastically reduce trade frequency without guaranteeing better results.
* **Optimize parameters via backtesting:** Before adopting new indicators live, backtest them on your data. For example, you could require ADX > 25 and OBV trending up for longs or use a Bollinger‑Band squeeze as a pre‑condition. The thresholds may need adjustment for your market and timeframe.
* **Focus on expectancy, not just win rate:** A strategy with a win rate slightly below 50 % can still be profitable if average winners are larger than losers. Consider using ATR to size stops and maintain a favourable risk‑to‑reward ratio.
* **Risk management and trade management still matter:** Even with good filters, markets are unpredictable. Use disciplined stops, position sizing and a consistent exit plan.

In summary, adding a trend‑strength filter like **ADX**, a time‑based trend identifier like **Aroon**, a momentum oscillator like the **stochastic**, and a volume‑flow indicator such as **EOM** or **OBV** can help you avoid low‑probability candlestick setups. However, no combination of indicators guarantees a specific win rate; thorough backtesting and sound risk management are essential.
