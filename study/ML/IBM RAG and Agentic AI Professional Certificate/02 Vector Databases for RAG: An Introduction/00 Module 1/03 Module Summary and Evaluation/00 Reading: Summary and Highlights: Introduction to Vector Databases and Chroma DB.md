# Reading: Summary and Highlights: Introduction to Vector Databases and Chroma DB

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- That vector databases simplify data storage, organization, and retrieval of complex data types, including images, likes, sounds, text files, pattern data, map data, genomic information, and others.
- That you can use vector databases for analysis tasks that group items, classify items, and suggest relationships among items.
- That vector databases, an integral part of machine learning, and for data in diverse domains, offer high performance and scalability.
- That vector databases store data as mathematical objects defined by size and direction.
- That vector databases use distributed computing, indexing, and parallel processing techniques to quickly manage big datasets and process queries.
- That a vector is an array of numerical values relating to different features or data attributes.
- That vector-based database types include in-memory, disk-based, distributed, graph-based, and time-based databases.
- That vector-based databases speed performance for recommendation systems, social network analysis, knowledge graphs, graph analysis, and other complex tasks.
- That dedicated vector databases use data structures, reversed indexes, product quantization, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) that provides scalability, delivers speed, and enhanced customization.
- That popular database vector database vendors include FAISS, Annoy, and Milvus.
- That databases that support vector search are either regular database systems or data processing frameworks that let you store data as BLOBs, arrays, or user-defined types.
- That notable vendors that support vector search include SingleStore with its support for IBM watsonx.ai, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RedisAI, Apache MongoDB, and Apache Cassandra.
- That organizations can make data-driven apps that work well and can be expanded to many areas using their strengths.
- That you can use vector databases for image and video analysis, including feature aspects, similarity searches, and real-time data processing.
- That vector databases use embeddings and cross-domain suggestions to enhance the completeness of recommendation systems.
- That GPS, fleet management, and real-time traffic routing suggestions are built on vector database geospatial processing capabilities.
- That vector databases enable marketing and social sites to scale resources to manage user profiles, deliver trend analysis, and optimize their Cloud and other hardware use.
- How to perform similarity search manually.
- That Chroma DB is a powerful vector database designed for various retrieval tasks.
- That Chroma DB supports multi-modal retrieval, metadata filtering, vector search, and full-text search.
- That deploying Chroma DB can be done using client-server architecture or standalone mode.
- That Chroma DB integrates with popular frameworks and supports multiple programming languages.
- That Chroma DB uses an advanced algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search, which efficiently finds the approximately closest chunks to a query within a collection.
- That Chroma DB is suitable for a wide range of applications, including recommender systems, document search, image retrieval, and AI-based chatbots.
- How to perform similarity search using Chroma DB.
