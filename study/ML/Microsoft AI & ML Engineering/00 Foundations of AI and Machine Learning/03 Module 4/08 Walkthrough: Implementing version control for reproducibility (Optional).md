# Walkthrough: Implementing version control for reproducibility (Optional)

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we will review the version control activity where you were tasked with quantifying changes to a piece of pseudo software and assigning appropriate version numbers. 

This guide will explain the rationale behind each version number assignment, helping you understand how to apply version control principles correctly in your projects.

By the end of this reading, you will be able to: 

- Describe the principles of semantic versioning.
- Analyze software changes and determine the appropriate version number.
- Reflect on the importance of version control in software development.

## 1. Understanding versioning principles

Before diving into the solutions, let's briefly review the principles of semantic versioning, which were used to guide the version number assignments:

- **Patch version (X.X.1):** Indicates minor changes, such as bug fixes or small improvements that do not alter the software’s overall functionality.
- **Minor version (X.1.X):** Used when new features or significant enhancements are added that do not break existing functionality.
- **Major version (1.X.X):** Reserved for significant changes, including breaking changes or major overhauls that alter the core functionality of the software.

## 2. Walkthrough of the version control activity

### Change set 1

**Changes**

- Updated the software’s user interface to improve usability.
- Fixed a minor bug that caused the program to crash under specific conditions.
- No changes to core functionality.

**Analysis**

The changes in this set involve a user interface improvement and a bug fix, which are important but do not affect the core functionality or introduce new features. This qualifies the changes as a patch update.

**Correct version number:** `1.0.1`

**Explanation**

The update primarily addresses a bug and makes a small improvement, so the patch version number is incremented from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.

### Change set 2

**Changes**

- Added a new feature that allows users to export data in CSV format.
- Refactored the codebase to improve performance and maintainability.
- No breaking changes were introduced.

**Analysis**

This set introduces a new feature (CSV export) and includes significant code refactoring. While the new feature adds functionality, there are no breaking changes, making this suitable for a minor version update.

**Correct version number:** `1.1.0`

**Explanation**

The minor version number is incremented from `1.0.1` to `1.1.0` because a new feature was added without altering existing functionality.

---

### Change set 3

**Changes**

- Completed a major overhaul of the software’s core functionality, changing the way data is processed.
- Introduced backward-incompatible changes, requiring users to update their datasets.
- Added support for a new file format (JSON) for data import.

**Analysis**

The changes here are significant and include a major overhaul of the core functionality with backward-incompatible updates. This necessitates a major version update.

**Correct version number:** `2.0.0`

**Explanation**

Given the scope of the changes, including breaking changes that affect how the software interacts with user data, the major version number is incremented from `1.X.X` to `2.0.0`.

## 3. Reflecting on the solutions

Understanding how to properly quantify changes and assign version numbers is crucial for maintaining a well-organized and predictable software development process. Here’s why the correct application of version control principles is important:

- **Predictability:** Users and developers can understand the impact of changes by simply looking at the version number. A major version update signals significant changes, while a minor or patch update indicates smaller, less impactful changes.
- **Collaboration:** Version control helps teams collaborate effectively. When everyone follows the same versioning standards, it’s easier to track progress, integrate changes, and manage different project branches.
- **Reproducibility:** Proper versioning ensures that you can always reproduce past results by returning to a specific version of your code, data, or models. This is especially important in AI/ML projects where reproducibility is key to validating results.

## 4. Applying version control in your projects

To effectively implement version control in your projects, remember these key practices:

- **Regular commits:** Make small, regular commits to track progress and make it easier to identify and fix issues.
- **Branching:** Use branches to work on new features, experiments, or bug fixes independently of the main project codebase.
- **Consistent versioning:** Follow semantic versioning principles consistently across all aspects of your project—code, data, and models.
- **Documentation:** Always document the changes associated with each version. This makes it easier to understand the history of your project and communicate with collaborators.

## Conclusion

This walkthrough has provided a detailed explanation of how to correctly quantify changes and assign version numbers in the context of version control. By applying these principles, you can ensure that your software development process is organized, predictable, and scalable. 

Implementing effective version control is not just about managing code—it’s about maintaining the integrity and reliability of your entire project.
