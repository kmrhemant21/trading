# I want to start writing algo for trading. What should be my best strategy to save my capital lets say I will start from 1 lakh per day. When I should stop

To save your trading capital and make your algo trading journey both systematic and safe, you need to establish solid risk management protocols and strict rules for when to stop trading each day. Here’s a proven risk management framework tailored for a starting capital of ₹1 lakh per day:

## Capital Preservation Strategies

- **Risk per Trade:** Never risk more than 1–2% of your total capital on a single trade. For ₹1 lakh, this means your risk per trade should not exceed ₹1,000–₹2,000. Position sizing should be calculated accordingly.[^1][^2][^3]
- **Daily Loss Limit:** Set a maximum daily loss limit, e.g., 1% of your capital (₹1,000). If you hit this limit due to consecutive losses or bad market conditions, stop trading for the day—even if you see new opportunities. This prevents large drawdowns and emotional trading mistakes.[^2][^3]
- **Stop-Loss Orders:** Always use stop-losses. Base them on a fixed % (e.g., 1–2%) below your entry price, important support/resistance levels, or volatility metrics like the Average True Range (ATR). This ensures small losses don’t become significantly damaging.[^4][^5][^6]
- **Trailing Stops:** As your trades become profitable, use trailing stops to lock in gains and allow winners to run. Trailing stops should move dynamically, either based on a percentage of price movement or volatility.[^5][^1]
- **Diversification:** Don’t rely on a single asset or strategy. Spread your trades across multiple, uncorrelated instruments and strategies to reduce overall risk.[^7]
- **Automation and Discipline:** Automate your rules so emotions don’t interfere. Stick to your predefined rules strictly, and update them only after careful analysis or backtesting.[^8][^7]


## When Should You Stop Trading Each Day?

- **Maximum Daily Loss Hit:** If your cumulative losses reach your daily cap (e.g., ₹1,000), stop trading immediately for the day.[^3][^2]
- **Maximum Number of Consecutive Losses:** Some algos stop trading after a set number of consecutive losing trades (e.g., 3–5), to avoid trading in unfavorable conditions.[^9]
- **Time-Based Stops:** After a specific holding period—such as 48 hours for mean reversion strategies, or end-of-day for intraday trades—exit your positions, to avoid overnight risks.[^1]
- **End-of-Profit Target:** Set daily profit goals and stop if you achieve them. Avoid giving back profits through overtrading when you’ve already reached your target.


## Practical Example for ₹1 Lakh

- Risk per trade: ₹1,000 maximum
- Daily loss limit: ₹1,000 maximum (if lost, stop trading)
- Number of trades: If you lose on all trades, you lose only 10% in 10 days—protects capital for long-term learning.[^2]
- Always use stop-loss and avoid emotional decisions.


## Key Takeaways

- **Set hard limits** for risk: per trade and per day.
- **Automate your exit rules**: stop trading when daily loss is hit, or after several consecutive losses.
- **Always use stop-loss and trailing stops.**
- **Review and refine your strategies** regularly based on results and backtesting.
- The best capital preservation strategy is **discipline and rule-based execution**.[^7][^4][^5][^2]

By integrating these controls into your algorithm, you protect your capital and sustain trading over the long term—even through losing streaks or unpredictable market behavior.
