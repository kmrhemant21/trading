Given that the dataset for these reviews is relatively small, your strategy leverages a larger, accessible dataset of magazine articles. The plan is to pretrain the model on this expansive magazine dataset to capture a broad understanding of text and language patterns. Subsequently, the model will undergo fine-tuning on the smaller, specific dataset of movie reviews to adapt its learned features to the particular task of recommending movies.\n","\n","\n","\n","![Documents Overload](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IMDvs-jpgkFICi5fhx6Fr7LBPie55jA.jpg)\n","\n","Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in several ways, each with its advantages and disadvantages:\n","\n","1. **Training the model on the small movie dataset:**\n","   - **Advantages:** Directly training on the movie review data ensures that the model is highly specialized and tailored to the specific characteristics and nuances of the dataset.\n","   - **Disadvantages:** Due to the small size of the dataset, the model is at a higher risk of overfitting. There might not be enough data to effectively capture all of the complexities of language and sentiment in movie reviews.\n","\n","2. **Pretraining the model on a larger general-domain text and fine-tuning the movie dataset for each parameter:**\n","   - **Advantages:** This approach allows every part of the model to learn from the movie reviews, potentially improving its accuracy on the specific task.\n","   - **Disadvantages:** Fine-tuning all parameters with a small dataset can still lead to overfitting. It also requires huge computational resources and time, as adjustments across all parameters might lead to numerous iterations of training.\n","\n","3. **Fine-tuning on the final layer only:**\n","   - **Advantages:** Fine-tuning only the final layer reduces the risk of overfitting, as the bulk of the model retains its pretrained structure. This method is faster and less resource-intensive.\n","   - **Disadvantages:** Because only the final layer is adjusted, the model might not fully adapt to the specifics of the movie reviews, potentially limiting its effectiveness in understanding deeper contextual nuances.\n","\n","Each method offers a balance between adapting to the specifics of the movie review dataset and maintaining the robustness and generalizability learned from the larger magazine article dataset. Choosing the right strategy depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as available computational resources, the urgency of deployment, and the desired accuracy and specificity of the recommender system.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2965cac3-a944-4ef1-9872-fa84d71bf350","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# __Table of contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Install-required-libraries\">Install required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Import-required-libraries\">Import required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Define-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Positional-encodings\">Positional encodings</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Import-IMDB-dataset\">Import IMDB dataset</a></li>\n","    <ol>\n","        <li><a href=\"#IMDB-dataset-overview\">IMDB dataset overview</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Dataset-composition\">Dataset composition</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Applications\">Applications</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Challenges\">Challenges</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Dataset-splits\">Dataset splits</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Data-loader\">Data loader</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Neural-network\">Neural network</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </ol>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Training\">Training</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Train-IMDB\">Train IMDB</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Fine-tune-a-model-pretrained-on-the-AG-News-dataset\">Fine-tune a model pretrained on the AG News dataset</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Fine-tune-the-final-layer-only\">Fine-tune the final layer only</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise:-Unfreeze-specific-layers-for-fine-tuning\">Exercise: Unfreeze specific layers for fine-tuning</a></li>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8e5a4de0-e49f-4fde-8b3f-2627e952fec8","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dcb4e60b-135c-4b7c-add3-150e8b249665","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n","\n","- Define and pretrain a transformer-based neural network using PyTorch for a classification task\n","- Fully fine-tune the pretrained model for a different classification task\n","- Compare results by fine-tuning only the last layer of the pretrained model\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"34dcd2f5-7be7-4e39-8a97-748d75ab6e04","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fdb9d5b8-0895-48fe-a370-a9094c36f151","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"244e3e68-b3f8-4c1e-a522-206b3d119cec","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Install required libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bc9c440c-7d4b-40c5-9069-7a7738670576","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, you'll use the following libraries, which are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the code in the following cell__ to install them.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7d884014-db92-4578-a5ff-5fd00cef7ec3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[" __Note__: The package installation step may take a few minutes to complete.
