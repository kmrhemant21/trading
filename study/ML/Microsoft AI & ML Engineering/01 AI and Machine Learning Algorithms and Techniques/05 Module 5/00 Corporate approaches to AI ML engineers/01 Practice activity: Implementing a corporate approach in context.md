# Practice activity: Implementing a corporate approach in context

## Introduction

In this activity, you are tasked with analyzing a real-world business problem, selecting the most appropriate AI/ML techniques, and planning the deployment and maintenance of a machine learning solution. The provided case study revolves around predictive maintenance for a manufacturing plant, where the goal is to use AI/ML to reduce unexpected machine failures and optimize maintenance schedules. By the end of this activity, you will have developed a comprehensive approach for deploying and maintaining an AI/ML system in a production environment.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Analyze key business challenges and requirements for AI/ML solutions.
- Propose suitable AI/ML techniques and models based on the problem's context.
- Plan for the deployment and monitoring of the AI/ML system.
- Develop strategies for handling system failures, model drift, and scalability.

## Step-by-step instructions

### Step 1: Review the case study

You will be provided with a case study that describes a business challenge or problem that requires AI/ML solutions. The case study may be real or hypothetical but will outline key issues that need to be addressed, such as system failures, performance degradation, deployment hurdles, or maintenance issues.

#### Case study example: Predictive maintenance for a manufacturing plant

A large manufacturing plant is facing frequent machine breakdowns, resulting in costly downtime and delays in production. The plant currently uses manual checks and scheduled maintenance, but this is not preventing unexpected failures. The goal is to implement a predictive maintenance system using AI/ML techniques to detect early signs of equipment failure and optimize the maintenance schedule.

### Step 2: Identify key problems and requirements

Your first task is to identify and analyze the key problems presented in the case study. Think through the following:

- What are the primary challenges (e.g., downtime due to unexpected failures, suboptimal maintenance schedules, poor detection of early failure signs)?
- What data is available or could be collected to solve this problem (e.g., machine sensor data, historical failure logs, maintenance records)?
- What are the deployment requirements (e.g., real-time analysis, scalable solutions, integration with existing systems)?

#### Examples

- The plant collects sensor data such as vibration, temperature, and pressure from machines, but the data is underutilized.
- The challenge is to detect potential failures before they happen and ensure that maintenance is performed only when necessary to reduce downtime and costs.

### Step 3: Propose AI/ML solutions

Based on the identified problems and requirements, think through different AI/ML techniques that can be applied to solve the case study. You'll need to consider which models, algorithms, or approaches would work best given the data and the context of the problem.

#### Model selection:

- Which AI/ML models are suitable (e.g., anomaly detection, regression, classification models)?
- Consider using techniques like time-series analysis for sensor data, regression models to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment, or anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns that signal potential failures.

#### Data preprocessing:

- What data preprocessing is necessary before feeding it into the model (e.g., normalizing sensor data, dealing with missing values, feature selection)?

#### Model training:

- How would you train the model? Consider the training data required, the model's accuracy, and methods for evaluating the performance (e.g., cross-validation, test sets).

#### Example

For the predictive maintenance system, you could deploy a regression model that estimates the RUL of each machine based on historical sensor data. Alternatively, you could use anomaly detection algorithms to flag abnormal behavior that could indicate an upcoming failure.

### Step 4: Deploy and monitor

Next, think through the deployment strategy. Consider the following:

#### Deployment environment:

- Where will the AI/ML system be deployed (e.g., on-premise, cloud-based, edge computing for real-time analysis)?
- What are the infrastructure requirements (e.g., computational resources, storage, network access)?

#### System integration:

- How will the AI/ML system integrate with existing infrastructure (e.g., linking with machine control systems, maintenance scheduling software)?
- Will there be a need for real-time alerts or dashboards to display predictions?

#### Monitoring and maintenance:

- How will you monitor the AI/ML system once it's deployed? Will it require ongoing retraining, tuning, or updating of the model as new data is collected?

#### Example

You may choose to deploy the system on an edge device for real-time monitoring of the equipment, ensuring the model can analyze sensor data as it's collected. The AI/ML model could trigger an alert when anomalies are detected, allowing maintenance teams to act before a failure occurs.

### Step 5: Address system failures and maintenance

In this step, you'll need to think about how to repair or adjust the AI/ML system in case of issues. Consider the following:

#### Error handling:

- What steps would you take if the model starts generating false positives or false negatives? How would you recalibrate the system?

#### Model drift:

- How will you handle model drift, where the model's performance degrades over time due to changes in the underlying data (e.g., new types of equipment or changes in operating conditions)?
- Would you automate retraining, or would it require manual intervention?

#### Scalability:

- How will you scale the system if the business grows or more machines need to be monitored? What considerations will be necessary for maintaining model accuracy and computational efficiency?

#### Examples

- If the predictive maintenance model starts flagging too many false positives, leading to unnecessary maintenance, you could adjust the model's sensitivity or retrain it with additional data.
- Implementing a process for continuous monitoring and periodic retraining can help the system adapt to changing machine behaviors or operating conditions.
